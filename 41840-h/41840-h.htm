<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> preparing the following work, it was intended to present
a systematic and somewhat complete statement of the
principles of Geology, within such limits that they may be
thoroughly studied in the time usually allotted to this
science.</p>

<p>A sufficient number of leading facts has been introduced
to enable the learner to feel that every important principle
is a conclusion to which he has himself arrived; and yet, for
the purpose of compression, that fullness of detail has been
avoided with which more extended works abound. In furtherance
of the same object, authorities are seldom cited.</p>

<p>The consideration of geological changes is made a distinct
chapter, subsequent to the one on the arrangement of
materials. It should, however, be remembered that these
processes of arranging and disturbing are not thus separated
in time. In nature the two processes are always going
on together.</p>

<p>It seemed important to exhibit the science with as much
unity and completeness as possible; and hence, discussions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
upon debatable points in Theoretical Geology, so interesting
to mature geologists, would have been out of place here;
and yet those more intricate subjects have not been omitted.
A large proportion of the work is devoted to the
explanation of geological phenomena, in order to convey an
idea of the modes of investigation adopted, and the kind of
evidence relied on. Where diversities of opinion exist, that
view has been selected which seemed most in harmony with
the facts; and the connection has not often been interrupted
to combat, or even to state, the antagonist view.</p>

<p>Technical terms have, in a few instances, been introduced,
and principles referred to, which are subsequently explained.
The index will, however, enable the student to understand
them, without a separate glossary.</p>

<p>Some may prefer to commence with the second chapter,
deferring the study of the elementary substances, minerals
and rocks, to the last. Such a course may be pursued without
special inconvenience.</p>

<p>Questions have been added, for the convenience of those
teachers who may prefer to conduct their recitations by this
means. But, when the circumstances of the case admit of
it, a much more complete knowledge of the subject will be
acquired by pupils who are required to analyze the sections,
and proceed with the recitation themselves; while the teacher
has only to correct misapprehension, explain what may
seem obscure, and introduce additional illustrations.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="caption2">OF THE MATERIALS WHICH COMPOSE THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="I_ELEMENTARY_SUBSTANCES" id="I_ELEMENTARY_SUBSTANCES"></a>
SECTION I.&mdash;ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are about sixty substances known to the chemist which
are considered as elementary; but most of them are rarely met
with, and only in minute quantities. A few of them are, however,
so abundant, in the composition of the crust of the earth, as to render
some attention to them necessary.</p>

<p><i>Oxygen</i> is more widely diffused than any other substance. It
is an ingredient of water and of the atmosphere, the former containing
eighty-eight per cent., and the latter twenty-one. Nearly
all rocks contain oxygen in combination with the metallic and
metalloid bases, and the average proportion of oxygen which they
contain is about forty-five per cent.; so that it will not differ
much from the truth to consider the oxygen in the earth&rsquo;s crust as
equal in weight to all the other substances which enter into its
composition.</p>

<p><i>Hydrogen</i> occurs in nature principally in combination with
oxygen, forming water. It is also an ingredient in bitumen and
bituminous coal.</p>

<p><i>Nitrogen</i> is confined almost entirely to the atmosphere, of which
it forms four-fifths. It enters into the composition of some varieties
of coal, and is sparingly diffused in most fossiliferous rocks.</p>

<p>One of the most important substances in nature is <i>carbon</i>. It
constitutes the principal part of all the varieties of coal, as well as
of graphite, peat and bituminous matter. A much larger amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of carbon exists in the carbonic acid which is combined with the
oxides of the metalloids and metals. The most abundant of these
compounds is limestone, which contains about twelve per cent, of
carbon.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of volcanoes <i>sulphur</i> is found pure and in
a crystalline form. It is a constant ingredient in volcanic rocks,
and in several of the most important ores, particularly those of
lead, copper and iron. The most abundant sulphate is gypsum,
which contains twenty-six per cent, of sulphur. In small quantities
it is widely diffused in rocks, and in the waters of the ocean.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine</i> is found principally as an ingredient of rock-salt, which
contains sixty per cent, of it, and of sea-water, which contains one
and a half per cent.</p>

<p><i>Fluorine</i> is found, though very sparingly, in nearly all the
unstratified rocks. It forms nearly half of the mineral known as
Derbyshire spar.</p>

<p>Of the metals, <i>Iron</i> is the only one that is found abundantly.
It enters into the composition of nearly all mineral substances. It
is generally combined with oxygen, and occurs less frequently as a
carbonate or sulphuret. Of volcanic rocks it forms about twenty
per cent. Its ores are sometimes found in the form of dikes or
seams, having been injected from below; at other times, in the
form of nodules or stratified masses, like other rocks of mechanical
origin.</p>

<p><i>Manganese</i> is likewise extensively diffused, but in very small
quantity. The other metals are often met with, but their localities
are of very limited extent.</p>

<p>Of the metallic bases of the earths and alkalies, <i>Silicium</i> is the
most abundant. It generally occurs in the form of silex, which is
an oxide of the metal. There are but few rocks in which it is
not found in considerable amount.</p>

<p><i>Aluminium</i> generally occurs as an oxide, in which form it is
alumina. It is the base of the different varieties of clay and clay-slate.
It is also a constituent of felspar and mica.</p>

<p><i>Potassium</i> is an ingredient of felspar and mica, and hence is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
found in all the primary and in most of the volcanic rocks, as
well as in the stratified rocks derived from them.</p>

<p><i>Sodium</i> is a constituent of a variety of felspar which is somewhat
abundant in volcanic rocks. Its principal source is the
extensive beds of rock-salt, and the same substance in a state of
solution in the waters of the ocean.</p>

<p><i>Calcium</i> constitutes about forty per cent, of limestone, and is
an ingredient in nearly all igneous rocks. This metal, in the state
of an oxide, is lime.</p>

<p><i>Magnesium</i> is somewhat abundant, but less so than calcium. It
is one of the bases of dolomite and magnesian limestone, and is an
ingredient of talc and all talcose rocks.</p>

<p>The substances now enumerated constitute nearly the entire
mineral mass of the crust of the earth. They may be arranged in
the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>These substances, chemically combined, form <i>Simple Minerals</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="II_SIMPLE_MINERALS" id="II_SIMPLE_MINERALS"></a>
SECTION II.&mdash;SIMPLE MINERALS.</p>

<p>All substances found in the earth or upon its surface, which are
not the products of art or of organic life, are regarded by the
mineralogist as <i>simple minerals</i>. About four hundred mineral
species are known, and the varieties are much more numerous; but
only a small number of them are so abundant as to claim the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
attention of the geologist. An acquaintance with the following
species is, however, necessary.</p>

<p><i>Quartz</i> is probably the most abundant mineral in nature. It
is composed wholly of silex. Its specific gravity is 2.65. It is the
hardest of the common minerals, gives sparks with steel, scratches
glass, and breaks into irregular angular fragments under the hammer.
When crystallized, its most common form is that of a six-sided
prism, terminated by six-sided pyramids. When pure, it is transparent
or translucent, and its lustre is highly vitreous. The
transparent variety is called <i>rock crystal</i>. When purple, it is
<i>amethyst</i>. When faint red, it is <i>rose quartz</i>. When its color is
dark brown, or gray, and it has a conchoidal fracture, it is <i>flint</i>.
When quartz occurs in white, tuberous masses, of a resinous lustre
and conchoidal fracture, it is <i>opal</i>. The precious opal is distinguished
by its lively play of colors. <i>Jasper</i> is opaque, and contains
a small per cent, of oxide of iron, by which it is colored dull
red, yellowish red or brown. The light-colored, massive, translucent
variety is <i>chalcedony</i>. The flesh-colored specimens are
<i>carnelian</i>. When composed of layers of chalcedony of different
colors, it becomes <i>agate</i>. Several of the varieties of quartz, such
as amethyst, opal, carnelian and agate, are used to considerable
extent in jewelry.</p>

<p><i>Felspar</i> is composed of silex, alumina and potassa. It resembles
quartz, but it is not as hard, cleaves more readily, and is not generally
transparent. Its specific gravity is 2.47. Its lustre is
feebly vitreous, but pearly on its cleavage faces. Its color is
sometimes green, but generally dull white, and often inclined to
red or flesh-color.</p>

<p><i>Mica</i> is composed of the same ingredients as felspar, together
with oxide of iron. Its specific gravity is nearly three. It is
often colorless, but frequently green, smoky, or black. It may
be known by its capability of division into exceedingly thin, transparent,
elastic plates.</p>

<p><i>Hornblende</i> is composed of silex, alumina and magnesia. Its
specific gravity is a little above three. Its color is generally some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
shade of green. When dark green or black, whether in a massive
or crystalline state, it is <i>common hornblende</i>. When light green,
it is <i>actinolite</i>. The white variety is <i>tremolite</i>. When it is composed
of flexible fibres, it is <i>asbestus</i>; and when the fibres have also
a silky lustre, it is <i>amianthus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Augite</i> or <i>Pyroxene</i> has, till recently, been considered as a
variety of hornblende. Its specific gravity is slightly different;
its composition is the same, and in general appearance it is not
easily distinguished from hornblende. It has, however, been made
a distinct species, because its crystalline form is different.</p>

<p><i>Hypersthene</i> is composed of silex, magnesia and oxide of iron.
Its specific gravity is 3.38. It closely resembles hornblende. The
lustre of its cleavage faces is metallic pearly. Its color is grayish
or greenish black.</p>

<p><i>Talc</i> is composed of silex and magnesia. Its specific gravity is
2.7. It resembles mica in its general appearance and in its lamellar
structure, but it is easily distinguished from it by its plates
being not elastic, and by its soapy feel. Its color is generally some
shade of green. <i>Soapstone</i> is an impure variety of talc, of a light
gray color, earthy texture, and is unctuous to the touch. <i>Chlorite</i>,
another impure variety, is a dark green rock, massive, easily
cut with a knife, and unctuous to the touch.</p>

<p><i>Serpentine</i> is composed of silex and magnesia. Its specific
gravity is 2.55. It is generally massive, unctuous to the
touch, and of a green color. It is often variegated with spots
of green of different shades. With a mixture of carbonate of
lime it forms the <i>verd antique marble</i>.</p>

<p><i>Carbonate of Lime</i>, or common limestone, is composed of carbonic
acid and lime. Its specific gravity is 2.65. It presents a
great variety of forms. In a crystalline state it is generally transparent,
and when so, possesses the property of double refraction.
It may be distinguished from every other common species by its
rapid effervescence with acids. It readily cleaves parallel to all
the faces of the primary form, which is a rhombohedron.</p>

<p><i>Sulphate of Lime</i>, or Gypsum, is composed of sulphuric acid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and lime. Its specific gravity is 2.32. When crystalline, it has a
pearly lustre, is transparent, and goes under the name of <i>Selenite</i>.
<i>Common Gypsum</i> resembles the other earthy limestones, but it is
softer, and may be readily distinguished by its not effervescing
with acids.</p>

<p>To the minerals now enumerated may be added the following,
which are of frequent occurrence, but not in great quantities;
namely, carbonate of magnesia, oxide of iron, iron pyrites, rock-salt,
coal, bitumen, schorl and garnet.</p>

<p>These simple minerals, either in separate masses or mingled
more or less intimately together, compose almost wholly the
earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="III_MINERAL_MASSES" id="III_MINERAL_MASSES"></a>
SECTION III.&mdash;THE MINERAL MASSES WHICH FORM THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.</p>

<p>That portion of the structure of the earth which is accessible to
man is called the <i>crust of the earth</i>.</p>

<p>The mineral masses which compose it, whether in a solid state,
like granite and limestone, or in a yielding state, like beds of sand
and clay, are called <i>rocks</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>unstratified rocks</i> are Granite, Hypersthene rock, Limestone
and Serpentine, and the Trappean and Volcanic rocks.</p>

<p><i>Granite</i> is a rock of a light gray color, and is composed of
quartz, felspar and mica, in variable proportions, confusedly crystallized
together. The felspar is generally the predominant mineral.
It is sometimes of a very coarse texture, the separate minerals
occurring in masses of a foot or more in diameter. At other
times it is so fine-grained that the constituent minerals can scarcely
be recognized by the naked eye; and between these extremes there
is every variety. The term granite is not, however, confined to an
aggregate of these three minerals. In some instances the felspar
so predominates as almost to exclude the other minerals, when it
is called <i>felspathic granite</i>. When the quartz appears in the
form of irregular and broken lines, somewhat resembling written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
characters, in a base of felspar, it is called <i>graphic granite</i>. When
talc takes the place of mica, it is <i>talcose granite</i>. When hornblende
takes the place of mica, it is <i>syenite</i>. Granite or any
rock becomes <i>porphyritic</i> when it contains imbedded crystals of
felspar.</p>

<p>There is a rock of crystalline structure, like granite, but of a
darker color, which is called <i>hypersthene rock</i>. It is composed of
Labrador felspar and hypersthene. The mineral species <i>serpentine</i>
and <i>limestone</i> often occur unstratified in considerable quantities.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic rocks</i> consist of the materials ejected from the craters
of volcanoes. They are composed of essentially the same minerals
as trap rocks. When the material has been thrown out in a
melted state, it is called <i>lava</i>. Lava, at the time of its ejection,
contains a large amount of watery vapor at a high temperature.
Under the immense pressure to which it is subjected in the volcanic
foci, it may exist in the form of water; but when the lava is thrown
out at the crater, the pressure cannot much exceed that of the
atmosphere. The particles of water at once assume the gaseous
form. As lava possesses considerable viscidity, the steam does not
escape, but renders the upper portion of the mass vesicular. This
vesicular lava is called <i>scori√¶</i>. By the movement of the stream
of lava, these vesicles become drawn out into fine capillary tubes,
converting the scori√¶ into <i>pumice-stone</i>.</p>

<p>A large part of the materials ejected from volcanoes is in the
form of dust, cinders and angular fragments of rock. These soon
become solidified, forming <i>volcanic tuff</i>, or <i>volcanic breccia</i>. In
submarine eruptions these fragments are spread out by the water
into strata, upon which other materials, not volcanic, are afterwards
deposited. These interposed strata are called volcanic grits.</p>

<p>The <i>trappean rocks</i> are composed of felspar, mingled intimately
and in small particles with augite or hornblende. They also contain
iron and potassa. They are often <i>porphyritic</i>. When they
contain spherical cavities, filled with some other mineral, such as
chlorite, carbonate of lime or agate, they are called <i>amygdaloidal
trap</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal varieties of trappean rock are basalt, green stone,
and trachyte. In <i>basalt</i>, augite, or, in some cases, hornblende, is
the predominant mineral. It is a heavy, close-grained rock, of a
black or dark brown color. <i>Greenstone</i> differs from basalt in
containing a much larger proportion of felspar. Its structure is
more granular, and frequently it assumes so much of the crystalline
form as to pass insensibly into syenite or granite. It is a
dark colored rock, with a slight tinge of green. Both green stone
and basalt are disposed to assume the columnar form, the columns
being arranged at right angles to the faces of the fissure into which
the trap is injected. When it is spread out into broad horizontal
masses, the columns are vertical. (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1.</a> <i>Trachyte</i> is composed
principally of felspar, is of a grayish color, and rough to the touch.</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_1" id="Fig_1"></a>Fig. 1.</p>
<img src="images/fig001.png" width="361" height="211" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Of the <i>stratified</i> rocks the following are the most important:</p>

<p><i>Gneiss</i> is a rock closely resembling granite. It is an aggregate
of the same minerals, but the proportion of mica is somewhat
greater. The only distinction between them is that the gneiss is
stratified, but the stratification is often so indistinct that it passes
insensibly into granite. Generally, however, the stratification is
so distinct as to present a marked difference.</p>

<p><i>Mica slate</i> is such a modification of gneiss that the mica
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
becomes the predominant mineral, with a small intermixture of
quartz and felspar. Consequently the stratification becomes very
distinct, so as sometimes to render the mass divisible into thin
sheets. The stratification is often wavy, and sometimes much
contorted.</p>

<p><i>Sandstone</i> consists of grains or fragments of any other rock,
but more frequently of siliceous rocks. The fragments are consolidated,
sometimes without any visible cement, but often by a
paste of argillaceous or calcareous substance. The color varies
with that of the rock from which it was derived. Generally, however,
it is either drab or is colored red by oxide of iron. The
fragments are sometimes so minute as scarcely to give the rock the
appearance of sandstone. When they are of considerable size and
rounded, the rock is called <i>conglomerate</i>. When they are angular,
it is called <i>breccia</i>. <i>Greensand</i> is a friable mixture of siliceous
and calcareous particles, colored by a slight intermixture of
green earth or chlorite.</p>

<p><i>Limestone</i> is a very abundant rock, and occurs in many different
forms. In transparent crystals it is <i>Iceland spar</i>. When
white and crystalline, it is <i>primary limestone</i>, <i>saccharine limestone</i>,
or <i>statuary marble</i>. When sub-crystalline it is generally
more or less colored. It is often <i>clouded</i> with bands or patches of
white in a ground of some dark color. When its texture is close,
and the crystallization scarcely apparent, it is <i>compact limestone</i>.
The white, earthy variety is chalk. A variety of limestone composed
of small spheres is called <i>o√∂lite</i>. <i>Lias</i> is the name given
to an impure argillaceous variety of a brown or blue color. Any
rock which contains a considerable proportion of carbonate of lime,
and which rapidly disintegrates on exposure to the atmosphere, is
called <i>marl</i>. Limestone sometimes contains carbonate of magnesia.
It is then <i>magnesian limestone</i>, or <i>dolomite</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clay</i> consists of a mixture of siliceous and aluminous earth. It
is tough, highly plastic, and generally of a lead blue color. It is
always stratified, and often divided into very thin lamin√¶, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
are separated by sprinklings of sand only sufficient to keep them
distinct.</p>

<p><i>Clay slate</i>, or <i>argillaceous schist</i>, is composed of the same materials
as clay, and differs from it only in having become solidified.
Its color is gray, dark brown or black. In some beds it is purple.
<i>Shale</i> is the same material in a state of partial solidification. On
exposure to the weather, it soon disintegrates, and is finally reconverted
into clay. All the varieties of argillaceous rock are easily
distinguished by a peculiar odor which they emit when breathed
upon.</p>

<p>Argillaceous slate sometimes takes into its composition portions
of some other mineral, such as talc, mica, or hornblende. When
any of these minerals becomes so abundant as to constitute a considerable
part of the mass, the rock becomes <i>talcose</i>, <i>micaceous</i>, or
<i>hornblende slate</i>. Sometimes this last variety loses all appearance
of a fissile structure, and is composed almost wholly of hornblende.
It is then called <i>hornblende rock</i>.</p>

<p><i>Diluvium</i> is the name applied to masses of sand, gravel, and
large rocks, called boulders, heaped confusedly together on the
surface of the earth. It is also called <i>drift</i>.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="I_CLASSIFICATION" id="I_CLASSIFICATION"></a>
SECTION I.&mdash;THE CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first place, we divide rocks into <i>stratified</i> and <i>unstratified</i>.
This division is one which will in general be easily
recognized, even by the most inexperienced observer; and the distinction
is important, because it separates the rocks of igneous origin
from those which have been produced by deposition of sediment
from water.</p>

<p>It will be shown hereafter that a part of the unstratified rocks
have been formed at or near the surface of the earth; that is, they
have taken their present form by passing from a state of fusion to
a solid state above or between the stratified rocks, as in the case of
lava (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2, A</a>). The other unstratified rocks have cooled so as
to take the solid form below the stratified rocks, as at B. The
first are called <i>epigene</i>, or <i>volcanic rocks</i>; the last, <i>hypogene</i>, or
<i>plutonic rocks</i>.</p>

<p>The lowest portion of the second division, the stratified rocks,
are termed <i>non-fossiliferous</i>, from the fact that they contain no
evidence of the existence of organic beings at the time when they
were deposited. Their relation to the other rocks is shown at C.
It is supposed that these rocks have been subjected to great
changes by heat from the igneous rocks below them. On this
account Mr. Lyell proposes to call them <i>metamorphic rocks</i>. The
other portions of the stratified rocks are <i>fossiliferous</i>, containing
the remains of organic beings which lived at the period when the
rocks were deposited. They are represented at D. The division
of the last-named rocks info groups will be given hereafter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>We have then four principal classes of rocks: <i>Plutonic

<p class="caption3"><a name="II_PLUTONIC_ROCKS" id="II_PLUTONIC_ROCKS"></a>
SECTION II.&mdash;THE PLUTONIC ROCKS.</p>

<p>Granite is by far the most important of this class of rocks. Of
its thickness no estimate can be made, as no mining operations
have ever penetrated through it, and none of the most extensive
displacements of rocks by natural causes has brought to the surface
any other rock on which it rests. It may, therefore, be considered
the foundation rock, the skeleton of the earth, upon which
all the other formations are supported. The whole amount of
granite in the earth&rsquo;s crust may be greater than that of all other
rocks, but it comes up through the other formations so as to be
exposed over only a comparatively small portion of the surface,
and this is generally the central portion of mountain ranges, or the
highest parts of broken, hill country. Still, it is not unfrequently
found in the more level regions, in the form of slightly elevated
ridges, with the stratified rocks reclining against it.</p>

<p>The structure of granite seems frequently to be a confused
mixture of the minerals which compose it, without any approach
to order in their arrangement; but in many cases it is found to
split freely in certain directions, and to work with difficulty in any
other. This may result from an arrangement of the integrant
crystals, so that their cleavage planes approach more or less nearly
to parallelism. When this is the case with the mica or felspar, it
must diminish the cohesion in a direction perpendicular to these
planes, and thus facilitate the cleavage of the mass.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Granite is found to penetrate the stratified rocks in the form of
veins. The following section (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) will show the relation of
granite veins to the granitic mass below. The granite which is
quarried for architectural purposes is often in comparatively small
quantities, disappearing at the distance
of a few hundred yards beneath the
stratified rock; or else it exists in the
form of isolated dome-shaped masses.
It is probable that, if they could be followed
sufficiently far, they would be
found to be portions of dikes coming
from the general mass of granite below.
Even the granite nuclei of the
great mountain ranges may be considered
as injected dikes of enormous magnitude.</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_4" id="Fig_4"></a>Fig. 4.</p>
<img src="images/fig004.png" width="166" height="165" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Granite is itself intersected with granite veins more frequently,
perhaps, than any other rocks; but the vein is a coarser granite
than the rock which it divides.
It is not uncommon to find one set
of dikes intercepted and cut off by
a second set, and the second by a
third. The substance of the dikes
was, of course, in a liquid state when
it was injected, and the first must
have become solid before the second
was thrown in; hence the dikes are
of different ages. The dikes <i>a b c</i>,
represented in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, must have
been injected in the order in which they are lettered.</p>

<p>It is probable that, by the process of cooling, the liquid mass
from which these dikes have proceeded has been gradually solidifying
from the surface downwards. If so, it would follow that
the granite nearest the surface (<a href="#Fig_2">1, Fig. 2</a>) is the oldest, and the
newest is that which is at the greatest distance below (4). It is
possible that at great depths granite may be still forming, that
is, taking the solid form, though of this there can be no direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
proof. There is, however, proof that it has been liquid at periods
of time very distant from each other; for the dikes sometimes
reach to the top of the coal formation (for example), and then
spread themselves out horizontally, as at <i>a</i>, showing that the rock
above the coal had not then been deposited. Another dike will
extend through the new red sandstone, as at <i>b</i>, and spread itself out
horizontally as before. These horizontal layers of granite, by their
position in strata whose ages are known, indicate the periods when
granite has existed in a liquid state. Granite veins have been discovered
in the Pyrenees as recent as the close of the cretaceous
period, and in the Andes they have been found among the tertiary
rocks.</p>

<p>There are several other rocks, of minor importance, often found
in connection with granite. Hypersthene rock, in a few cases,
forms the principal part of mountain masses. Greenstone is more
frequently associated with the trappean rocks, but it sometimes
passes imperceptibly into syenite and common granite. Limestone
is found in considerable abundance, and serpentine in small quantities,
as primary rocks, and have evidently been formed like
granite, by solidifying from a state of fusion.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="III_VOLCANIC_ROCKS" id="III_VOLCANIC_ROCKS"></a>
SECTION III.&mdash;THE VOLCANIC ROCKS.</p>

<p>The volcanic rocks consist of materials ejected from volcanoes.
They are, however, ejected in very <i>different states</i>; sometimes as
dust, sand, angular fragments of rock, cinders, &amp;c., and sometimes
as lava streams. In some instances, the lava has so little fluidity
that it accumulates in a dome-shaped mass over the orifice of eruption,
and perhaps in a few instances it has been thrust upward in
a solid state.</p>

<p>There are <i>two principal varieties</i> of lava, the trachytic, consisting
mostly of felspar, and the basaltic, consisting of hornblende.
When both kinds are products of the same eruption, the trachytic
lava is thrown out first, and the basaltic last. The reason of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this is, that felspar is lighter than hornblende, and probably rises
to the surface of the lava mass at the volcanic focus, and the basaltic
lava is therefore reserved till the trachytic has been thrown off.</p>

<p>These, like other rocks, have been produced at different epochs.
There is, however, great difficulty in determining their age; There
are some differences of structure and composition observed, in comparing
the older and newer lavas; but the only method that can be
relied on to determine their age is their relation to other rocks.
When they occur between strata whose age is determined by imbedded
fossils, they must be of intermediate age between the inferior
and superior strata.</p>

<p>1. <i>Modern Volcanic Rocks.</i>&mdash;Some of the volcanic rocks are
of modern origin, and are produced by volcanoes now active. The
total amount of these, and of all the other volcanic rocks, is probably
less than that of either of the other principal divisions of
rocks; yet they form no inconsiderable part of the earth&rsquo;s crust.
The number of active volcanoes is not far from three hundred, and
the number of eruptions annually is estimated at about twenty.
In some cases, the lava consists of only a single stream, of but a
few hundred yards in extent. It extends, however, not unfrequently
twenty miles in length, and two or three hundred yards in
breadth. The eruption of Mount Loa, on the island of Hawaii, in
1840, from the crater of Kilauea, covered an area of fifteen square
miles to the depth of twelve feet; and another eruption of the same
mountain, in 1843, covered an area of at least fifty square miles.
The eruption in Iceland, in 1783, continued in almost incessant
activity for a year, and sent off two streams in opposite directions,
which reached a distance of fifty miles in one case, and of forty in
the other, with a width varying from three to fifteen miles, and with
an average depth of more than a hundred feet. The size of some
of the volcanic mountains will also assist in forming an idea of the
amount of volcanic rocks. Monte Nuovo, near Naples, which is a
mile and a half in circumference and four hundred and forty feet
high, was thrown up in a single day. √Ütna, which is eleven thousand
feet high, and eighty-seven miles in circumference at its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
base, has probably been produced wholly by its own eruptions. A
large part of the chain of the Andes consists of volcanic rock, but
the proportion we have not the means of estimating.</p>

<p>2. <i>Tertiary Lavas.</i>&mdash;There is another class of volcanic products,
which are so situated with reference to the tertiary strata
that they must be referred to that period. The principal localities
of these lavas, so far as yet known, are Italy, Spain, Central
France, Hungary, and Germany. They are also found in South
America. Those of Central France have been studied with the
most care. They occur in several groups, but they were the seats
of volcanic activity during the same epoch, and formed parts of one
extensive volcanic region. Each of these minor areas, embracing
a circle of twenty or thirty miles in diameter, is covered with hills
two or three thousand feet in height, which are composed entirely
of volcanic products, like the cone of √Ütna. On many of them
there are perfectly-formed craters still remaining. Numerous
streams of lava have flowed from these craters, some of which can
now be traced, throughout their whole extent, with as much certainty
as if they were eruptions of the present century. Some of
the lavas have accumulated around the orifices of eruption, forming
rounded, dome-shaped eminences. These lavas generally consist
of trachyte, and have therefore a low specific gravity, and
imperfect fluidity. The basaltic lavas have often spread out over
broad areas, and, when they have been confined in valleys, have
reached a distance of fifteen miles or more from their source.
There still remain indications of a current of lava which was
thirty miles long, six broad, and in a part of its course from four
to six hundred feet deep. The above sketch (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>) will give
some idea of the highly volcanic aspect which the district of
Auvergne, in France, presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_5" id="Fig_5"></a>Fig. 5.</p>
<img src="images/fig005.png" width="346" height="118" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The unimpaired state of some of the cones and craters, and of
the lava currents, would lead to the impression that these regions
have been the theatre of intense volcanic action within a very
recent period. But there is good reason to believe that this has
not been the case. &ldquo;The high antiquity of the most modern of
these volcanoes is indeed sufficiently obvious. Had any of them
been in a state of activity in the age of Julius C√¶sar, that general,
who encamped upon the plains of Auvergne and laid siege to its
principal city, could hardly have failed to notice them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is equally certain that the commencement of their activity
was at a late period in the history of the earth. Lava currents
are frequently found in France resting upon the early tertiary
strata, but no lava current is found below them. The later tertiary
strata contain pebbles of volcanic rocks, showing that lavas
had been previously ejected, but none are found in the older strata
of this formation. We must, therefore, conclude that these volcanic
tracts assumed their volcanic character at some intermediate
point in the tertiary period.</p>

<p>When we find that their activity commenced at so late a period
and closed so long ago, we might be led to suppose that it was of
very short duration. But a great number of facts, in the present
condition of the country, require that we should assign to them a
very prolonged activity. A single instance will be sufficient to
show the nature of the evidence upon which this conclusion rests.
The heavy line (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) represents the present form of one of the
valleys. A bed of lava forms the highest point of land represented,
and a second bed is found in an intermediate part of the
slope. The position of the upper bed must have been a valley,
when the lava flowed there. We may represent this valley by the
line <i>a b c</i>. The slow operation of natural denuding causes at
length excavated the valley <i>d e h</i>, when another lava current
flowed through it, covering its bed of pebbles, as before. The same
denuding causes have at length produced the present valley, <i>f g h</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
These remnants of lava-currents, as they have formed a very imperishable
rock, have protected the subjacent strata from erosion, and
furnish evidence of the position of the valley at different periods.
When we consider with what extreme slowness denuding causes
produce changes on the surface, and what extensive changes they
have here nevertheless effected in the interval between the production
of the different lava currents, we are compelled to feel that
that interval was a very prolonged one. Yet this period, however
long it may have been, was evidently less than the period of activity
of these volcanoes.</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_6" id="Fig_6"></a>Fig. 6.</p>

</div>

<p>3. <i>Volcanic rocks of an earlier date</i> are also found, sometimes
as distinct lavas, though generally as volcanic grits. They occur
interstratified with the cretaceous rocks, and with every other
formation of the fossiliferous series, showing that, from the earliest
times, these rocks have been accumulating as they now are.</p>

<p><i>The trappean rocks</i> may, in a general classification, be considered
as volcanic. It will be shown, hereafter, that they are the
lavas of submarine volcanoes. They do not, however, occur in the
form of lava currents, but in great tabular masses, generally
between stratified rocks, or in the form of dikes. They are also
entirely unconnected with cones or craters.</p>

<p>The trappean rocks occur more or less abundantly in all countries.
One of the most noted localities of this rock is a region
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
embracing the north of Ireland, and several of the islands on the
western coast of Scotland. It contains the celebrated Giant&rsquo;s
Causeway, which consists of a mass of columnar trap; also Fingal&rsquo;s
Cave, which is produced by a portion of the trap being columnar,
and thus disintegrating more rapidly than the rest, by the action
of the waves. An immense mass of greenstone trap, which has
generally been considered as a vast dike, though often a mile in
thickness, is found extending from New Haven to Northampton,
on the west side of the Connecticut river. It then crosses to the
east side, and continues in a northerly direction to the Massachusetts
line. Under different names, it constitutes a nearly continuous
and precipitous mountain range for about one hundred miles.
Dr. Hitchcock supposes this greenstone range to be, not an injected
dike, but a tabular mass of ancient lava, which was spread out on
the bed of the ocean during the period of the deposition of the
Connecticut river sandstone. It was subsequently covered with a
deposit of strata of great thickness, and then by subterranean forces
thrown into its present inclined position.</p>

<p>There is a mass of basaltic rock in the valley of the Columbia
river, in the Oregon Territory, which extends without interruption
for a distance of four hundred miles. Its breadth and thickness is
not known, but in some places the river has cut a channel in this
rock to a depth of four hundred feet. Its age has not been determined,
and it will, perhaps, be found to be a tertiary or modern
production.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="IV_NON-FOSSILIFEROUS_STRATIFIED" id="IV_NON-FOSSILIFEROUS_STRATIFIED"></a>
SECTION IV.&mdash;THE NON-FOSSILIFEROUS STRATIFIED (OR METAMORPHIC) ROCKS.</p>

<p>1. <i>Gneiss</i> is the most abundant rock in this class, and is generally
found reposing on granite. Its stratification is sometimes
very distinct, but it is often so imperfect that it can scarcely be
recognized. This is more frequently the case in the vicinity of
granite on which it rests, and into which it insensibly passes. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
large part of the material used for building purposes, under the
name of granite, is obscurely marked gneiss. In all primary
countries it is an abundant rock, occupying extensive districts, and
sometimes forming mountain masses.</p>

<p>2. <i>Mica slate</i> lies next above gneiss, and is a very abundant
rock. As it differs from gneiss only in the proportion of mica
which it contains, and as the quantity of mica in it is very different
in different places, it is often difficult to make the distinction
between them. It also passes by insensible degrees into the
argillaceous rocks. Many of the argillaceous rocks are found, upon
close examination, to contain mica in minute scales in such abundance
as to make it doubtful whether they ought not to be regarded
as mica slates; that is, the metamorphic action by which argillaceous
slate is converted into mica slate had proceeded so far, before it was
arrested, that it becomes impossible to say whether the argillaceous
or micaceous characters predominate.</p>

<p>3. <i>Argillaceous slate.</i>&mdash;The last rock of this series is a slaty
rock, more or less highly argillaceous. It does not differ in lithological
characters from the same rock in the higher strata. It is
doubtful whether the roofing-slates should be considered as belonging
to the metamorphic series or not. They have been subjected
to a very high degree of metamorphic action, and yet strata intimately
associated with them have, in occasional instances, contained
fossils.</p>

<p>It is not easy to fix the exact upper limit of this series. The
fossils are few, obscure, and seldom met with in the lowest fossiliferous
series; and the transition is very gradual from the distinctly
metamorphic to the fossiliferous rocks. This renders it impossible
always to determine accurately the line of separation.</p>

<p>The gneiss, mica slate and argillaceous slate, have the order of
superposition in which they are here named. They differ only in
the amount of metamorphic action to which they have been subjected;
and the gneiss which is most highly metamorphic has, by
being the lowest, been most acted upon,&mdash;the mica slate less, and
the argillaceous slate least. In a particular locality, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
lowest rock which was subjected to these causes of change, instead
of having been of such a character as to produce gneiss, may have
been a limestone, and in that case the lowest metamorphic rock
would be a saccharine marble. In another locality the lowest rock
may have been a sandstone, which would be converted into quartz
rock. Hence there may occur, in any part of the metamorphic
series, crystalline limestone, quartz rock, hornblende slate, chlorite
slate, and talcose slate; and any one of these rocks may be as
abundant in any particular region, as gneiss, mica slate or argillaceous
slate, is in another.</p>

<p>The metamorphic rocks occur in all countries where there has
been any considerable amount of volcanic action, and their total
amount is very great; but their stratification is so confused and
contorted, their superposition so irregular, and denudations have
been so extensive, that no estimate can be made of their thickness.
They are, perhaps, equal to all the other stratified rocks.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="V_FOSSILIFEROUS" id="V_FOSSILIFEROUS"></a>
SECTION V.&mdash;THE FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.</p>

<p>The fossiliferous rocks are divided into seven systems, which are
readily distinguished by the order of superposition, lithological characters
and organic remains. These systems are the Silurian, the
Old Red Sandstone, the Carboniferous, the New Red Sandstone, the
O√∂litic, the Cretaceous, and the Tertiary systems. There is also
an eighth system now in process of formation.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of some geologists that there is another system
situated between the metamorphic rocks and the silurian system.
It has been called by Dr. Emmons, who has studied it with much
care, the &ldquo;Taconic System,&rdquo; the Taconic Mountains, in the
western part of Massachusetts, being composed of these rocks. It
is the lower part of what has been called, in England and Wales,
the <i>Cambrian system</i>.</p>

<p>The strata of this system have a nearly vertical position, and
consist principally of black, greenish and purple slates, of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
thickness. Granular quartz rock, however, occurs in considerable
quantity, and in this country two thick and important beds of
limestone are found. These limestones are occasionally white and
crystalline. Generally, however, as a mass, they are a dark, nearly
black rock, with a network of lines of a lighter color. All the
clouded marbles for architectural and ornamental purposes are from
these beds, and our roofing and writing slates are all obtained from
the argillaceous portion of this system.</p>

<p>The number of species of organic remains contained in this
system is very small, and these, so far as discovered, belong to the
annelida, with a few doubtful cases of mollusca. This system of
rocks is found coming to the surface in a large part of New England,
and the eastern part of New York, also in the western part
of England and Wales.</p>

<p>Those geologists who deny the existence of this system consider
these rocks as parts of the silurian system which have been most
disturbed by subterranean forces, and most altered by proximity to
igneous rocks. The annexed sketch (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>) will exhibit the
relations here referred to. Certain portions of the silurian rocks
are supposed to have been thrown into folds by the upheaval of the
primary rocks. The plications nearest to the intrusive granite
would be most altered. That part of the figure below the line <i>a a</i>
represents the outcropping edges as they now appear, the upper
portion of the folds having been removed by some abrading cause.</p>

<img src="images/fig007.png" width="337" height="129" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As it is yet uncertain which of these views is correct, convenience
will justify us in retaining the name of Cambrian system till
further investigations shall settle the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <i>The Silurian System.</i>&mdash;The following tabular arrangement
exhibits the divisions of the system as recognized in England, in
New York, in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and in Ohio.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 470px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>This name, <i>Silurian</i>, was first used to designate the lowest
well-characterized fossiliferous rocks in England. But it is now
used to embrace the whole system as it occurs elsewhere. It is
well exhibited in New York, both in consequence of its great
development there, and because the whole system is only slightly
acted upon by disturbing forces, so that the outcropping edge of
each division extends over a large surface.</p>

<p>This system is of great thickness, amounting, in places where
it is well developed, to twenty thousand feet.</p>

<p>The Champlain division commences with a quartzose sandstone,
passing gradually into limestone, which is succeeded by a very
thick argillaceous deposit, the Utica slate and Hudson River group.
The Ontario division in the lower part is a mass of sandstone.
Above this is the Clinton group, consisting of shales and sandstones.
The most important part of this group, in an economical
point of view, is a fossiliferous, argillaceous iron ore, coextensive
with the group in this country, and is worked to supply a large
number of furnaces. The last of the division is the Niagara group,
which commences with a mass of shale, and becoming at length
calcareous, it terminates in a firm compact limestone. This limestone
has withstood the action of denuding causes better than the
shales either above or below it. It therefore presents a bold
escarpment at its outcrop, and occasions waterfalls wherever
streams of water cross it. The falls of Niagara are formed by this
rock. The Niagara limestone, in its extension westward, becomes
the lead-bearing rock of Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin. The
Helderberg division is a succession of highly fossiliferous limestones,
with the intervention of only occasional beds of grits and shales.
One member of the series is the Onondaga Salt group. The water
obtained from this group in New York annually furnishes immense
quantities of salt. The Erie division consists of a thick mass of
shales and sandstones.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The fossils of this system are very numerous, but consist mostly
of the lower forms of animal life. <i>Corals</i> (Fig. <a href="#Fig_8">8.</a>
 and 9) are
abundant, and constitute in some places a large proportion of
the limestones. The <i>Crinoidea</i>, or lily-shaped animals, consist
of a jointed stem permanently attached,
and bearing at the free
extremity of the stem an expanded
portion, which is the pelvis, or
digestive cavity. The mouth is
surrounded with a series of leaf-like
tentacula, which serve the purpose
of seizing and holding food.
<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a> represents the pelvis of
one of the silurian fossils. The
general character of the animal is
better represented by <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>.
The most abundant fossils of this
period are the lowest orders of
<i>bivalve mollusca</i> (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). The
<i>Cephalopoda</i> are characterized by
having the organs of locomotion attached to the head. The shell
of several species is peculiar in being divided into distinct cells, or
chambers (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, <i>b d</i>), perforated by a tube (siphuncle <i>a</i>). These
fossil shells are sometimes straight, as the <i>Orthoceras</i> (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>), or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
curved, as shown in the several forms of <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>. The <i>Trilobite</i>
was an articulated, crustaceous animal, having two lines along the
back dividing it into three lobes, from which circumstance its name
is derived. It is found in great
numbers in the Silurian rocks
(<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>). In a few instances
remains of fishes have been
found, but they by no means
characterize the system.</p>

<p>The geographical range of
this system is probably greater
than that of any system of
rocks above it. It is found
occupying a large part of the
territory west of the Alleghany
Mountains, from Canada,
through New York, and the
other states, to Alabama; and
extending westward to and
beyond the Mississippi river.
It occupies a large district in
the west of England, and is
found in great force in the
north and east of Europe.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Old Red Sandstone.</i>&mdash;This formation consists almost
entirely of a sandstone of a red color. It admits of division into
three parts, though the characters vary in different places. The
lowest is a thin-bedded argillaceous sandstone, consisting of finely
levigated material, and easily splitting into thin sheets. From this
circumstance it has received the name of <i>tilestone</i>. The middle
portion is composed of nodules or concretions of limestone imbedded
in a paste of red sand and shale. This has been called by
English geologists, <i>cornstone</i>, and though very partially developed
in some regions where the system is found, it is yet a very persistent
member. The highest member of this formation is a mass of red
sandstone, often passing into a coarse <i>conglomerate</i>. In England
the thickness of the Old Red Sandstone is not less than ten thousand
feet. In this country it is scarcely three thousand feet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The fossils of this system are a few shells, a small number of vegetable
species, and in particular localities the remains of fishes in
great abundance. The system is characterized
principally by fossils of this
last kind. The fishes of this system
have a cartilaginous skeleton, but are
covered with plates of bone, which
were faced externally with enamel.
The jaws, which consisted of solid
bone, were not covered with integument.
The exterior bony covering
seems to have been the true skeleton,
as is, in part, the case with the tortoise.
In some of the fishes of this
period there is a wing-like expansion
on each side of the neck, which has
given them the name of <i>Pterychthis</i>
(<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). In others, as the <i>Cephalaspis</i>,
the plate of bone on the
back is so large as to cover nearly
the whole body, and make it resemble
a trilobite (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>This system has an extensive geographical range. In England,
it occupies a band of several miles in width, extending from the
Welsh border northward through Scotland to the Orkney Islands.
In this country, it forms the Catskill Mountains, in New York,
and extends south and west so as to underlie the coal-fields of
Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Carboniferous System.</i>&mdash;This system consists of three
parts, distinguished by lithological and fossil characters.</p>

<p>The <i>carboniferous limestone</i> is a dark-colored, compact limestone,
forming the base of the system, and reposing on the old red
sandstone. Its thickness is from six hundred to one thousand
feet, often with scarcely any intermixture of other rock; but it
sometimes loses its character of a limestone, and becomes a sandstone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
or conglomerate. It generally contains the ores of lead in
considerable quantity, and from this circumstance has been called
<i>metalliferous limestone</i>. In England it is the principal repository
of these ores. In the Western States it is the upper portion
of the lead-bearing strata.</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_17" id="Fig_17"></a>Fig. 17.</p>
<img src="images/fig017.png" width="301" height="316" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The fossils are marine, and very numerous. Corals and crinoidea
are very abundant. The crinoidea, in some localities, form so
large a part of the rock as to have given to it the name of encrinal
limestone. The orthoceras and trilobite are found, but become
extinct with this formation. Several species of bivalves, such as
Delthyris and Lept√¶na, are also common.</p>

<p>Next above the limestone lies the sandstone, sometimes called
<i>millstone grit</i>. It is generally drab-colored, but occasionally red.
Its thickness is often equal to that of the limestone. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it is fine-grained and compact; but generally it is coarse-grained,
and often passes into a conglomerate. It contains but few fossils,
and those of vegetable origin.</p>

<p>The highest part of the system is the <i>coal measures</i>. They
consist of beds of sandstone, limestone, shale, clay, ironstone and
coal, occurring without much uniformity in their order of superposition.
The coal measures have a thickness of about three thousand
feet. The sandstones and limestones are not distinguishable
from the sandstones and limestones in the lower part of the system.
The ironstone either occurs in concretionary nodules, often
formed around some organic nucleus, or it is an argillaceous ore,
having a slaty structure. In either case, it consists of subordinate
beds in the shale. The coal consists of several beds distributed
through the measures. The beds vary in thickness from a few
lines or inches to several feet. In a few cases beds have been
found measuring fifty or sixty feet in thickness. The workable
beds are ordinarily from three to six feet thick.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 265px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_18" id="Fig_18"></a>Fig. 18.</p>
<img src="images/fig018.png" width="265" height="130" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The carboniferous formation is very much disturbed by dikes,
faults (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>;
see also <a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>),
and other dislocations.
The amount
of change of position
in the strata, by
faults, is very various;
frequently
but a few feet. In
one case in England there is a fault of nearly a thousand feet.
There is a case of dislocation in Belgium where the strata are bent
into the form of the letter Z, so that a perpendicular shaft would
cut through the same bed of coal several times.</p>

<p>The characters and order of superposition which have now been
given may be regarded as the general type of the carboniferous
formation. There are, however, several important modifications.
1. Beds of coal sometimes alternate with beds of millstone grit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Thus, in Scotland and in the north of England, this intermediate
member of the system disappears, or, rather, is incorporated with
the coal measures. The same is true, to considerable extent, in
this country. 2. Sometimes the carboniferous limestone also disappears
as a distinct member of the system, partly by becoming
arenaceous, and partly by the intercalation of beds of coal. In
this last case, the whole formation from the old to the new red
sandstone becomes a series of coal measures. In this country the
carboniferous limestone is found very generally to underlie the
coal strata. 3. The fractures and faults, which were formerly supposed
to be characteristic of the coal formation, are seldom found
in the great coal-fields of this country, except in those of the
anthracite coal of Pennsylvania; and even there they are much
less common than in the coal-fields of Europe.</p>

<p>There are three principal varieties of coal, distinguished by the
different proportions of bitumen which they contain. The common
bituminous coal kindles readily, emits much smoke, and throws
out so much liquid bitumen that the whole soon cakes into a solid
mass. It contains about forty per cent, of bitumen. The second
kind, or cannel coal, contains twenty per cent., and inflames easily,
but does not agglutinate. The stone-coal, or anthracite, contains
scarcely any bitumen, ignites with difficulty, emits but little smoke,
and produces a very intense heat. The bituminous varieties are
always found in the least disturbed portions of the coal districts;
and the anthracite is found in the more broken and convulsed portions,
where we may suppose that the subterranean heat has been
sufficient to drive off the volatile bituminous part, and reduce it
to the anthracite form. Hence the eastern Pennsylvania coal-fields,
which lie near the principal axes of elevation of the Appalachian
Mountains, furnish only anthracite; while the same coal-seams,
in their extension to the western part of the state, are
bituminous.</p>

<p>Where coal is quarried in large quantity, a shaft is sunk through
the overlying strata to the coal-beds, and the coal is raised to the
surface by steam power. After the coal has been quarried to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
distance from the shaft, pillars of unquarried coal are left to support
the overlying strata. Fatal accidents have sometimes occurred
by the giving away of these supports. Over a large part of the
coal-fields of the United States it has not yet become necessary to
sink shafts. The quarrying is commenced at the outcrop of the
coal-bed; and, till the cover becomes of considerable thickness, it
has been found economical to &ldquo;strip&rdquo; off the overlying rock, rather
than to work a subterranean gallery.</p>

<p>Brine-springs are often found in the coal measures of sufficient
strength to be used in the manufacture of salt. This is now done
to considerable extent in Ohio. In the valley of the Kenhawa
river, Kentucky, the rocks of which belong to the carboniferous
system, the brine is nearly saturated with salt; and in some of the
borings they have even discovered beds of rock-salt of great thickness
and purity.</p>

<p>There is no other part of the geological series so obviously connected
with national prosperity as the coal formation. While a
country is new, the forests furnish an abundant supply of fuel; but
in the course of a few years these are consumed. This country will
soon be principally dependent upon its coal-mines for fuel, even for
domestic purposes; and, in carrying on the great branches of
national industry, such as the smelting and working of iron, and
in the formation of steam for the purposes of manufacture and
transportation, we are already mainly dependent upon mineral
coal. A nation which does not possess an abundant supply of this
mineral, <i>or which does not use it</i>, cannot long maintain a high
degree of national prosperity.</p>

<p>In these inexhaustible masses of coal, accumulated ages before
the existence of the human race, is a most obvious prospective
arrangement for securing our happiness and improvement. And
this arrangement embraces not only the accumulation of a combustible
material in such abundance, but also its juxtaposition with
an equally inexhaustible accumulation of iron ore, and the limestone
which is necessary as a flux in the reduction of the ore. So bulky
and heavy materials as coal and iron ore could neither of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have been transported to any considerable distance for the manufacture
of iron; and without the manufacture of iron on a large
scale, the present operations in manufactures and transportation
could never have been entered upon. A large proportion of the
iron furnaces in this country, and nearly all of them in Great
Britain, employ mineral coal for fuel, and obtain their ore from
the beds contained in the coal measures.</p>

<p>The fossils of the coal measures are almost entirely of vegetable
origin, and are very abundant. They are seldom found in the
coal-beds, but in the strata of
shale immediately above or
below the solid coal.</p>

<div class="fig_center">

<img src="images/fig019.png" width="330" height="411" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>Stigmaria</i> (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>) is found most abundantly, and in a
large proportion of cases to the exclusion of every other form, in
the lower shales. It consisted of a large dome-shaped mass, often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
three or four feet in diameter, with trailing branches, or roots,
spreading off horizontally to a distance of twenty feet. In a
few instances tree ferns have been found, petrified in a horizontal
position, and being apparently a mere continuation of the stigmaria.
Hence the stigmaria has been supposed to be the base of the tall
tree ferns, the leaves of which so abound in the upper shales. If
this is not the case, there are no forms of the existing flora of the
earth analogous to the stigmaria. It is always found in connection
with the coal-beds of the carboniferous formation, and never with
the coal-beds which sometimes occur in the later formations.</p>

<p>The tree ferns (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>) attained a height of fifty or sixty feet,
and a diameter of four feet. They have received the name of
<i>Sigillaria</i> in consequence of the seal-like impressions (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>)
with which the surface is covered, and which are the scars left
where the fronds have fallen off. These fronds (fern leaves) are
the most abundant fossil of the series. They are distinguished by
some peculiarity in form, as the Sphenopteris (wedge-shaped fern
leaf), Pachypteris (thick fern leaf), &amp;c. (Fig. <a href="#Fig_22">22.</a>
 and <a href="#Fig_23">23</a>.)</p>

which the surface was fluted,
and the markings are superficial,
and occur on the

a size as the tree ferns, but
to what general class of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
forest trees. Specimens are found four feet in diameter and

<p>The <i>Calamite</i> (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>) was a plant resembling, in its jointed
and striated surface, the equisetum (rush), but was sometimes
twelve inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The carboniferous formation exists more or less abundantly in
all the great divisions of the earth. It occurs in nearly all of the
countries of Europe. The largest deposits known are, however, in
the United States; especially in the States of Pennsylvania and
Virginia, and in Ohio.</p>

<p>4. <i>The New Red Sandstone.</i>&mdash;The lower division of this formation,
called the Permian system, consists of a thick mass of sandstones,
generally of a red color, with occasional alternations of
argillaceous rock, succeeded by a series of magnesian limestones.
The upper division, or Triassic system, is composed of a red conglomerate,
a limestone which has received the name of Muschelkalk
(shelly limestone), and a series of variegated marls and sandstones.</p>

<p>The ores of copper are found, to considerable extent, in this
formation. The rich copper mines of Germany are in the magnesian
limestone, or, as it is there called, Zechstein (minestone).
The Lake Superior copper mines occur in a red sandstone formation,
which will probably be found to belong to this system.</p>

<p>The salt-beds, salt springs, and beds of gypsum, are so, generally
found in this rock in England, that it has been called by
the English geologists the &ldquo;saliferous system.&rdquo; It is, however,
found that in other countries these minerals occur in equal abundance
in formations of an earlier and later date.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The fossils of this system are not abundant. In the Permian
portion, impressions of fishes are found, always with the peculiarity
that the tail is <i>heterocercal</i> (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>); that is, with the spine continued
into the upper lobe. The same peculiarity prevails in the
carboniferous and all the earlier formations. Fishes with the tail
<i>homocercal</i> begin to appear in the Triassic portion of this system,
and are found in all the subsequent formations. The remains of
saurians also occur in this formation.</p>

</div>

<p>The red sandstones seem to have been better adapted to retain
the forms which were impressed upon them than to preserve the
organic remains which were deposited in them. Hence, while
they contain but few fossils, the strata are often covered with
ripple marks, with sun cracks, occasioned by contraction while drying,
or with depressions produced by rain-drops, and the pits are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sometimes so perfect as to show the direction of the wind when
the drops fell. (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28.</a> The tracks of animals are also well
preserved. Some of them were produced by reptiles (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>,
<i>c</i>), and some probably by marsupial animals, but most of them
by birds (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). President Hitchcock has distinguished the tracks
of more than thirty species in the sandstones of the Connecticut
valley. Birds, reptiles and marsupial animals, seem to have been
first introduced during this period.</p>

<div class="fig_center">

<p>The new red sandstone is well developed in all its members on
the continent of Europe. In England, all the members are present,
except the Muschelkalk. The Triassic portion of it occurs in
North America. It is found in detached portions, probably as
parts of a continuous formation, in Nova Scotia, the eastern part
of Maine, the Connecticut valley, and from New Jersey southward
through Pennsylvania, Maryland, &amp;c., to South Carolina.</p>

<p>5. <i>The O√∂litic System.</i>&mdash;The lower portion of this system is
the Lias, and consists of a series of fissile, argillaceous limestone,
marl, and clays. The <i>O√∂lite</i> forms the intermediate member of the
system, and consists of alternations of clay, arenaceous rock and
limestone. Some of the limestones have an o√∂litic structure, and
the whole system takes its name from this circumstance, though
this structure is not found in all parts of it, and is often found in
other formations. The central part of the o√∂lite, the coral rag, is
principally a mass of corals and comminuted shells. The <i>Wealden</i>,
the highest member of the o√∂litic system, is an estuary deposit,
consisting of calcareous beds, followed by sandstone, and terminated
by the Wealden clay.</p>

<p>This system is throughout highly calcareous, and furnishes,
wherever it is developed, valuable materials for architectural and
ornamental purposes.</p>

<p>This system is distinguished for the great amount and variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of its organic remains. The <i>vegetable productions</i> were intermediate
between those of the coal period and those of the present
time. The upper o√∂lite, in the
south of England, contains the
stumps of trees and other plants,
rooted in a black carbonaceous
layer, evidently the soil from which
they grew. These stumps and prostrate
trunks are the remains of
coniferous trees of large growth.
(<a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30.</a>)</p>

<p>Corals occur in great abundance;
also encrinites (<a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>), mollusks (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>), and cephalopoda.</p>

<p>But this system is specially characterized
by the remains of saurian
reptiles. The Ichthyosaurus (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>, <i>a</i>)
was a marine animal, having the general form of a fish,
while its head, and especially its teeth, resemble those of the crocodile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
It was an air-breathing animal like the cetacea, and was
furnished with similar paddles. It was carnivorous, and was
undoubtedly the largest and most formidable animal existing in
the earlier part of the o√∂litic period. Its length could not have
been less than thirty or forty feet.</p>

<p>The <i>Plesiosaurus</i> (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>, <i>b</i>) was also a marine animal, and in
ninny respects similar to the Ichthyosaurus; but its general form
was more slender, its head was small, and its neck was of great
length, the cervical vertebr√¶ exceeding in number those of the
swan.</p>

<p>The <i>Pterodactyle</i> (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>) was
a small saurian, of the size, probably,
of our largest eagle. The
finger-bones, which in the other
saurians form the paddles, are in
the Pterodactyle very much lengthened,
so as to support a membranous
expansion, like that of the bat.
These wings were of sufficient size to enable it to sustain itself
in the air, and to make a rapid and easy flight.</p>

<p>The <i>Iguanodon</i> is a Wealden fossil, remarkable for its great
magnitude. It is estimated that its length was seventy feet. It
was a lizard, adapted for motion on land, and was herbivorous.</p>

<p>This formation is well developed in England, and, with the
exception of the Wealden, on the continent of Europe. It has been
supposed that no part of the o√∂litic series was to be found in this
country; but there is a highly arenaceous rock occupying the
valley of the James river, in the vicinity of Richmond, Virginia,
of considerable extent, and a thousand feet in thickness, containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a bed of coal of forty feet in thickness, which, from its fossils, must
be referred to the o√∂litic series.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Cretaceous Formation.</i>&mdash;The lower part of this formation
consists of <i>greensand</i>, interstratified with beds of clay. The
intermediate portion is a mixture of argillaceous greensand and
<i>impure chalk</i>. The upper part is composed of <i>chalk</i>, which is a
friable, nearly pure carbonate of lime. The strata of chalk are
separated, at intervals of from three to six feet, by layers of flint,
either in the form of nodules or of continuous strata.</p>

<p>These characters, by which the cretaceous system is known in
England, are but partially recognized elsewhere. Thus, in the
Alps, the &ldquo;Neocomian System,&rdquo; consisting of crystalline limestones,
is the equivalent of the English greensand; while the greensand

<p>The fossils of the cretaceous formation are very different from
those of the o√∂lite, and are such as to show that it was deposited
in deep seas. <i>Microscopic shells</i> are often so abundant as to constitute
a large proportion of the mass. <i>Zo√∂phytes</i> are very
numerous, such as sponges, corals, star-fishes (<a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>, <i>d e</i>), and
a few crinoidea (<i>b</i>). Mollusks were also abundant, and cephalopoda,
consisting of chamber-shells and belemnites
(<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>). The belemnite
probably resembled the existing
cuttle-fish; but the
remains consist, in most
cases, of a partially hollow calcareous substance (<i>b</i>), which was contained
within the animal, and formed its skeleton.</p>

<p>The chalk and greensand are largely developed in England;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and the same formation, with different lithological characters, is
found in great force flanking the principal mountain ranges of
southern Europe, and extending into Asia. In this country the
system commences with the greensand and friable limestones of
New Jersey, and following the Alleghany range to its southern
termination, it bends around into a north-western direction, and is
continued into Missouri.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Tertiary System.</i>&mdash;The tertiary strata embrace the
formations from the cretaceous to the human era. They consist
of clay, sand, sandstone, marl and limestone, and are distinguished
from the lower rocks by being less consolidated; though the limestones
are in some instances solidified, and resemble the strata of
earlier origin. The tertiary strata are generally of less thickness
than the older formations, and less continuous, being local deposits
formed in lakes and estuaries. In a few instances they have
been thrown into inclined positions, though in most cases they
have been but slightly disturbed, and raised but a few hundred
feet above the present level of the sea.</p>

<p>The late tertiary strata seldom overlap the older, so as to indicate
their relative ages by superposition. They have therefore been
separated into groups according to the proportions of living and
extinct species of shells which they are found to contain. The
oldest tertiary or <i>Eocene formation</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> contains only four per cent,
of living species, the <i>Miocene</i> contains seventeen per cent., the
Pleiocene forty per cent., and the <i>Pleistocene</i> ninety per cent.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <i>E√∂s</i>, dawn, and <i>kainos</i>, recent. The formation which commenced at <i>the
dawn of the recent period</i>, containing but a small number of living species.
Miocene (<i>meion</i>, less), less recent than the Pleiocene (<i>pleion</i>, more).
Pleistocene (<i>pleistos</i>, most), most recent.</p></div>

<p>During the pleistocene period, peculiar conditions existed, by
which a great amount of loose material, known by the name of
<i>drift</i>, was spread over the northern portions of both hemispheres.
In America it is found from Nova Scotia nearly to the Rocky
Mountains, and extending as far south as Pennsylvania and the
Ohio river. In Europe, it is found from the Atlantic to the Ural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Mountains, and reaching south into Germany and Poland. It is
also found in the colder portions of South America, and in the
vicinity of several mountains, as the Alps.</p>

<p>It consists of irregular accumulations of earthy substances
of different degrees of fineness, but characterized by containing
masses of rock of considerable size, often of many tons weight,
called boulders. Rocks having the same lithological characters
exist in situ north of where the boulders and other drift are now
found, though at a distance often of one or two hundred miles.
There can be no doubt but that the drift has been transported from
these northern localities; and the polished, striated and grooved
condition of the rocky surface, wherever the drift is distributed,
has obviously been produced by the passage of the drift materials
over it.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this period, while the land was a few hundred
feet below its present level, there were deposited in the valleys
of the drift region beds of blue and gray clay, materials
which are used in making bricks and coarse pottery; also beds of
sand, sometimes evenly spread out, but often thrown into irregular
mounds and ridges.</p>

<p>In regions which are not covered with drift,&mdash;as the south of
Europe and the United States,&mdash;the pleistocene deposits are
succeeded, without apparent change of conditions, by those which
are now taking place.</p>

<p>The formations of the tertiary period are distinguished from
those of the cretaceous period by the absence of deep-sea fossils,
and from the o√∂lite by the absence of its characteristic saurians.
The mollusks are also very different, such genera as the cerethium
(<a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>), murex (<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>), and conus (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>), which
abound in the present seas, first appearing in the tertiary period.
The nummulite (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>), a peculiar form of chambered shell, is
so abundant as to constitute in some places almost the entire rock.</p>

<p>The period is however characterized by the existence of a large
number of pachydermatous animals, of which the tapir, hog, horse
and elephant, are examples of living species.</p>

<p>The <i>Paleotherium</i> (<a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>) resembled, in most respects, the
tapir. It was furnished with a short proboscis, and the foot was
divided into three toes. The length of the largest species was
about that of the horse; but its body was larger, and it was of less
height.</p>

<p>The <i>Anoplotherium</i> (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>) was a more slender animal, and
resembled in size and general form the gazelle.</p>

<p>The <i>Megatherium</i>, an animal of the late tertiary epoch, was
larger than the existing species of elephant, and in its general
structure and habits resembled the sloth.</p>

<p>The <i>Mastodon</i> (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>) lived during the latest portion of the
tertiary epoch. Its remains are found most abundantly where the
animal seems to have perished by sinking into the soft marshy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ground near the brackish springs of New York and Kentucky.
But they are found also in Europe and Asia. It was larger
than any existing land animal, and was nearly allied in structure
and habits to the elephant.</p>

<p>The <i>Mammoth</i> was a species of elephant, now extinct, of which
remains are found with those of the mastodon, but in the greatest
abundance in Europe and Asia. A large number of skeletons,
many of them imperfect, have been discovered in the low grounds
in the south-east of England. It was this animal which was
found encased in ice and sand in Siberia, in 1804.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the existence of these huge animals, a
near approach was made to the present fauna of the earth, by the
introduction of ruminant animals resembling the ox and deer, and
especially by the existence of the class of animals which in anatomical
characters stands next to man, the apes and monkeys.</p>

<p>The tertiary system, though not generally so continuous over
extended areas as the older formations, yet constitutes the surface
of a very large part of Europe. (See <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>.) In the United
States the earlier portion is found along the seaboard, from New
Jersey to Louisiana, and extending back towards the mountains to
a distance varying from ten to one hundred miles. The later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
deposits are found in detached portions throughout the Eastern and
Middle States. It covers a large surface in South America, and
is found in India.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Recent Formation.</i>&mdash;It is intended to embrace in this
term strata which have been formed since the creation of man.
It is, however, impossible to separate them by any well-defined
characters from those of the tertiary period. The recent formation
consists of land which is forming by the filling up of lakes, and by
the increase of deltas from the accumulated sediment which rivers
have furnished.</p>

<p>There is, however, no doubt but that formations on a large
scale have continued in progress over extensive areas of the bed
of the sea; and they have been no less rapid, we may presume,
than they were in earlier periods. But, though they are preserving
the records of the present era, they will probably remain in a
great measure inaccessible for many ages.</p>

<p>These deposits, so far as they are accessible, are found to contain
the remains of plants and animals (including man) now living
in the vicinity where the deposits are forming.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="VI_FOSSILS" id="VI_FOSSILS"></a>
SECTION VI.&mdash;FOSSILS.</p>

<p>Any organic substance imbedded in a geological formation, or
any product of organic life, as a coprolite or a coin, or any marking
which an organic substance has given to a rock, is regarded as
a <i>fossil</i>. The study of fossils, as a branch of practical geology,
requires an acquaintance with the principles and the minute
details of botany and zoology. Without this knowledge, however,
many of the general conclusions to which the study of fossils has
led may be understood.</p>

<p>1. <i>Fossils are preserved in different ways.</i>&mdash;When any
organic substance is imbedded in a forming rock, it may itself
remain; or it may be removed by the infiltration of water, or other
causes, so gradually as to leave its form, and even its most delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
markings, in the rock; or some mineral substance may have been
substituted, and fill the space which the organic substance once
occupied; that is, it may be an organic substance preserved, it
may be an impression of it, or it may be a cast of it.</p>

<p>2. The process by which the substitution in this last case is
effected is called <i>mineralization</i>. The mineralizing ingredient is
generally derived from the contiguous rock. In siliceous rocks it
is silex. In calcareous rocks it is carbonate of lime. When iron
is diffused through a rock, it often becomes the mineralizer. The
substituted mineral is generally a very perfect representation of the
original fossil. We cannot therefore suppose that the original
substance was entirely removed before any of the mineral matter
was deposited. The substitution must have taken place particle by
particle, as the organic matter was removed. Fossils are, in fact,
often found, in which the mineralization has been arrested after it
had commenced, so that the fossil is in part an organic and in part
a mineral substance. It has been proved, by direct experiment,
that these changes of removal and substitution are simultaneous.
Pieces of wood were placed in a solution of sulphate of iron.
After a few days, the wood was found to be partially mineralized,
and after the remaining ligneous matter had been removed by
exposing it to a red heat, &ldquo;oxide of iron was found to have taken
the form of the wood so exactly, that even the dotted vessels,
peculiar to the species employed, were distinctly visible under the
microscope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. As the fossiliferous strata are generally of marine origin, it is
to be presumed that only a small proportion of terrestrial animals
are preserved; and our knowledge of the organic remains which
are preserved is yet so imperfect, that discoveries are constantly
making, as examinations are extended. Still, enough is known to
enable us to draw some satisfactory conclusions as to <i>the order in
which living beings were created upon the earth</i>.</p>

<p>Though most of the earlier organic forms which have been preserved
are of animal origin, yet vegetable remains occasionally
occur in connection with them, and we must suppose vegetables to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
have been produced abundantly. For all animal food consists of
vegetable substances, or of animal substances which have once
existed in the vegetable form. No animal is capable of effecting
those combinations of inorganic matter upon which its growth and
sustenance depend. We may therefore conclude that <i>the introduction
of animals and vegetables was contemporaneous</i>.</p>

<p>The greatest development of vegetable life was, however, during
the carboniferous period. The design of this abundant growth was
prospective. It was not produced for the support of animal life,
but for fuel, and stored till man should be introduced, and so far
advanced in civilization as to make this supply of carbonaceous
matter subservient to his wants and happiness.</p>

<p>In the earlier periods, the lower forms of animal life were,
beyond all comparison, the most abundant; yet the four great
divisions of the animal kingdom, Radiated, Articulated, Molluscous,
and Vertebrated animals, were all represented. There is,
however, no evidence that any vertebrated animals, except fishes,
were created till after the carboniferous period. In the next
formation, the new red sandstone, we find the tracks of reptiles
and birds, and probably of marsupial animals. The first evidence
of the existence of mammalia in great numbers is in the tertiary
period, when the pachydermata and edentata were so much more
abundant than they have ever been since, and when the bimana
first appear.</p>

<p>But there is no evidence from geology that man existed till
after the close of the tertiary period. The grounds upon which
contrary statements have sometimes been made are untenable. In
Ohio a very perfect impression of a human foot was found on a
slab of limestone of the silurian age. But it was subsequently
ascertained to have been common for the aborigines, in the vicinity
of their encampments, to cut in the rocks, with surprising accuracy,
the forms of the tracks of man and other animals.</p>

<p>There is a human skeleton in the British Museum imbedded in
solid limestone, and another in Paris, both taken from Guadaloupe.
It was at one time supposed, from the degree of solidification of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the limestone, that it must have been formed at an early geological
period; but it is found that the beach-sand of that island now
solidifies rapidly, from the carbonate of lime which the waters there
hold in solution. It is rendered probable that the skeletons found
there have not been buried more than a century and a half.</p>

<p>4. As many parts of the bed of the present seas, which are
probably receiving detrital matter constantly, are unfavorable for
the development of animal life, while other parts are highly
favorable, it might be presumed that animal life would be equally
scanty in particular localities while the earlier rocks were forming,
and in other localities very abundant. Hence some strata, for
hundreds of feet in thickness, are composed almost entirely of fossils,
while other strata are nearly or quite destitute of them. The
same member of a formation may in one place be full of fossils,
and in another without them. <i>The distribution of fossils</i> is
therefore subject to no general law; at least, none of which we can
avail ourselves, in the search for them.</p>

<p>5. The value of fossils in geology consists in the use which is
made of them in determining <i>the origin and age of strata</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 127px; top:200px;">

<img src="images/fig044.png" width="127" height="169" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As the animal species which inhabit bodies of fresh water are
always different from those found in the sea, their remains constitute
the best means of determining whether a formation is of <i>fresh
water</i> or <i>marine origin</i>. In order to decide this point, it may, in
some cases, be necessary to be acquainted with the habits of particular
species. In most cases, however, it will be sufficient to
remember that in fresh-water formations, first, there are no
sponges, corals, or chambered shells; second,
the univalves all have entire mouths (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>). Third, the bivalves are all bimuscular
(<a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>). If, therefore, a formation is found
to contain sponge, coral, a chambered shell,
a univalve with a deeply notched mouth (<a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>), or a unimuscular bivalve (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>), it
must be considered a marine formation.</p>

<p>We have seen that the same formation, as
exhibited in different places, differs in its
thickness, composition and degree of solidification. If we could
trace the strata through all the intermediate space, we might be
certain of their being the same formation, notwithstanding the
change in lithological characters. But this can seldom be done,
even for a few miles in extent. Sections of the strata are obtained
only occasionally, where rivers have cut through them, or where,
over limited areas, the soil has been removed from the outcropping
edges. It is also frequently the case that the strata are so much
disturbed that their position will furnish no aid in determining their
age. When folded axes occur (as here represented), the older strata
are often the uppermost.
There
is an instance in
the Alps in which
strata of vast
thickness have
been inverted during
the process
of upheaval, and
now rest on a
bed of rock formed from the debris which they had supplied.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/fig056.png" width="295" height="175" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet it is important to determine what formations are of the
same age, notwithstanding their displacements, difference in lithological
characters, and separation by great distances and by mountains
or oceans. This determination can be made only by a comparison
of the imbedded fossils. It is found that every formation,
and every important member of a formation, contains an assemblage
of fossils peculiar to itself. When very widely separated,
the species of fossils may not be identical, but so very similar that
they are regarded as equivalent species. <i>The identification of
formations</i> consists in the identification of fossils. It is for this
purpose mainly that fossils are regarded as of so great importance.</p>

<p>6. If each formation is characterized by the presence of new
species, it follows that <i>the work of creation was a progressive one</i>,
continued through long periods of time. The latest creation of which
we have any geological evidence is that of man. And if the leading
design of the existence of this earth was as a theatre for the
development of moral character, it is to be presumed that the work
of creation ceased when a species possessing moral capacities had
been introduced.</p>

<p>It follows also, from what has been said, that there has been a
constant disappearance, a death, of species. It would seem that
each species has a life assigned to it, which is to be completed and
surrendered. Though its continuance is many times longer than
the life of any individual of the species, yet <i>it is the course of
nature that species should disappear</i>.</p>

<p>There may be something in the constitution of each species by
which its continuance is limited, making an old age and death
necessary, as it is in individuals. But there are other causes by which
the duration of species may often be terminated. The subsidence
of New Holland would cause the destruction of a large number of
species. The preservation of the human species was at one time
effected only by a special and miraculous interference. Slowly operating
causes are now at work, by which many species, such as the
elephant, wolf and tiger, will at length become extinct. Their
existence in a natural state cannot long be continued in a civilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
country. The forest, their natural abode, disappears, and some
are intentionally destroyed, because they render life and property
unsafe. Under the operation of these causes, the Irish elk (cervus
giganteus) has become extinct, probably within the human era.
The Dodo, a gallinaceous bird, found living when maritime communication
between Europe and the East Indies was first established,
is now extinct. The Apteryx, a bird belonging to New
Zealand, has probably become extinct since the commencement of
the present century.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="VII_TIME_NECESSARY_FOR_FORMATION" id="VII_TIME_NECESSARY_FOR_FORMATION"></a>
SECTION VII.&mdash;THE TIME NECESSARY FOR THE FORMATION OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS.</p>

<p>There are no means of which the geologist can avail himself to
determine the antiquity of the earth, or the amount of time since
the sedimentary deposits commenced. But a nigh degree of
antiquity may yet be shown.</p>

<p>The materials for all the stratified rocks have been obtained
by the destruction of previously solidified igneous rocks. This
destruction may have been accomplished in part by the operation
of volcanic forces, but much of it is the result of slow disintegration,
and of the eroding power of running water; and we can
scarcely conceive of a period sufficiently protracted for such
results.</p>

<p>This conclusion of the high antiquity of the earth is confirmed
by observing that the stratified rocks consist of layers often not
thicker than sheets of paper, and probably not averaging the tenth
of an inch; and yet each layer is separate from the rest, in consequence
of some change in the conditions under which it was deposited.
Each layer was probably produced by the deposition of all
the sediment furnished at one time, and hence only as many layers
would be formed in a year as the number of freshets in the rivers
which furnished the materials. If we consider the fossiliferous and
metamorphic rocks to be each forty thousand feet in thickness,&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is not too large an estimate,&mdash;we must reckon the years by
hundreds of thousands to make the time sufficiently extended for
the result.</p>

<p>All the formations of any considerable extent now above the
surface of the sea existed before the creation of man, for none
of them contain any evidence of the existence of human beings;
and if they had existed while these strata were forming, sufficient
evidence would have been left of the fact, either in the form of
fossilized human bones, or of works of human art. Hence, whatever
be the estimate which we form of the antiquity of the earth,
from the slowness of denudation, or from the thickness of the
strata, we must now add to that estimate the period elapsed since
the creation of the human species.</p>

<p>We have seen that at different periods of the earth&rsquo;s history different
species of animals inhabited it. We are unable to fix with
accuracy the ordinary duration of species. But the species which
are now extinct probably had an existence as long-continued as
will be enjoyed by species now living. Many recent species are
known to have existed at least nearly six thousand years, without,
in most cases, any indications of their soon becoming extinct.
Whatever period be assigned as the ordinary duration of species,
that period has been several times repeated; for the earth has been
several times re-peopled, and every time by species which had not
before existed.</p>

<p>Moreover, the <i>amount</i> of organic matter in the strata must
have required long periods of time for its accumulation. The
vegetable deposits, now converted into coal, are generally several
feet thick, and often over a hundred feet, and are known to extend
over several thousand square miles, both in this country and in
Europe. Many of the sedimentary rocks consist almost entirely
of animal remains. The mountain limestone, for instance, is eight
hundred feet or more in thickness, and in some places consists of
the exuvi√¶ of encrinites and testacea.</p>

<p>In other cases the length of time required is shown, not from
the amount of organic remains, but from the evidence that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
deposited very slowly. The polishing stone called tripoli is found
in beds of ten or twelve feet in thickness, and is composed entirely
of the siliceous shells of animalcules, so minute that, according to
the estimate of Ehrenberg, the number in a cubic inch is forty-one
billions. Several other rocks, such as semi-opal and flint, are sometimes
found to have a similar constitution. The time necessary
for the accumulation of beds several feet thick by the shells of
animalcules so minute must have been very great.</p>

<p>Each of these facts carries us back to a period immeasurably
anterior to the creation of man, as the epoch when the sedimentary
deposits commenced. There are no facts in geology which point
to a different conclusion. It is of the utmost importance to the
geological student to familiarize himself with this principle. It will
assist him in comprehending the greatness of geological changes,
and in applying other principles in explanation of geological
phenomena.</p>

<p>This principle, so obvious to any one who allows himself to
reason from the facts which geology presents, has sometimes been
regarded as at variance with the Mosaic account of the creation.
And if this account really assigns an antiquity to the earth of not
more than six thousand years, the difficulty exists.</p>

<p>The statements made by Moses are found, upon examination, to
be of the most general character. They assert, in the first place, simply
that &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&rdquo;
The time which elapsed after this first act, and previously to the
acts of creation subsequently recorded, is not limited by the sacred
narrative. It may have been during this indefinite lapse of time
that God gave existence and enjoyment to a large number of animal
species on the surface of the earth, and at the same time
effected most of those physical changes in the crust of it which
have rendered it a fit abode for intellectual and moral beings.</p>

<p>But if the word <i>day</i>, in the first chapter of Genesis, be considered
to mean a prolonged period (and philologists regard such an
interpretation as admissible), then that chapter is a record of the
most important events in the history of the earth up to and including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the introduction of man. And the account, thus understood,
coincides with the results of geological examinations.</p>

<p>Instead, then, of discrepancy between the works and the word of
God, we have this remarkable fact, that a history of the earth,
written long before the science of geology was known, is not contradicted,
but confirmed, by the progress of science thus far.</p>

<p class="caption2">OF THE CHANGES TO WHICH THE CRUST OF THE EARTH<br />
HAS BEEN SUBJECTED.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="I_CHANGES_WHICH_HAVE_TAKEN_PLACE" id="I_CHANGES_WHICH_HAVE_TAKEN_PLACE"></a>
SECTION I.&mdash;CHANGES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT GREAT DEPTHS BELOW THE SURFACE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lowest change of winch we can gain any information
is the <i>formation of granite</i>. It will be shown hereafter that
it has been in a melted state, and that it has taken its present
form on cooling. But whether any considerable portions of the
granitic masses, or of the melted masses now below the surface,
have resulted from the fusion of stratified rocks, we have not
the means of determining. It is, however, not improbable, that
in the changes of level to which the crust of the earth has
been subjected, the stratified rocks may have gone down so far
as to become melted. At the same time, the melted rock which
is thrown to the surface by volcanoes is subjected to the various
destroying agencies by which it becomes sedimentary matter, to be
deposited as mechanical strata. Thus, as the igneous rocks from
below are brought up to furnish materials for mechanical strata,
there must be an equal amount of depression of the mechanical
strata towards the seats of igneous action. And if this change
takes place more rapidly than the thickness of crust increases,
then portions of the sedimentary rocks must be undergoing fusion.</p>

<p>Next above the granite an immense thickness of rock occurs,
which exhibits, from its stratification and from the water-worn fragments
which it contains, distinct evidence of its mechanical origin.
And yet it is very different from the later mechanical formations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
It is more highly crystalline; it has, to a great extent,
assumed a cleavage distinct from the planes of stratification, and
chemical affinity has been so far active as to produce new combinations,
and give to them their peculiar crystalline form, as in the
case of garnets, iron pyrites, &amp;c. These strata also differ from
those above them in containing no organic remains. It is not
certain that organic life existed on the earth at the time when
these rocks were deposited. Either it did not, or the evidence of
it in the strata of that period has been obliterated. The changes
have at least been sufficient to justify their being characterized as
<i>metamorphic rocks</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="II_CHANGES_IN_MASS" id="II_CHANGES_IN_MASS"></a>
SECTION II.&mdash;CHANGES IN THE MASS OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS.</p>

<p>1. The stratified rocks were deposited as mud or sand, and
were at first in a yielding state. Most of these deposits have
become <i>solidified rock</i>, such as limestone, clay slate and sandstone.
The chalk of England is, however, but imperfectly consolidated,
the great sandstone formation of New Holland is a friable
mass easily disintegrated, and occasionally beds of clay in a plastic
state are found as far down as the coal. Among the later rocks
the solidification is less general, though there is some degree of
hardening in all except the most superficial layers. The <i>fissile
structure</i> results from the solidification of the particles composing
each layer separately.</p>

<p>2. Since the solidification of the strata, or perhaps in connection
with it, there has been something of movement among the particles,
resulting in mineral veins, conchoidal structure, &amp;c. One
of the most general changes of this kind is that by which a mass
becomes separable into thin sheets, independent of the stratification,
and not parallel with it. This structure is represented by
<a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>, in which the heavier lines are those of stratification, and
the lighter of <i>cleavage</i>.</p>

<p>3. The strata have been everywhere more or less broken, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the <i>fractures</i>, nearly vertical, extend to groat depths. When a
fracture reaches the surface, it often becomes a channel for water.
It is thus widened by the erosion, the deepest parts become filled
with debris, and it becomes a <i>gorge</i>, <i>ravine</i> or <i>valley</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_48" id="Fig_48"></a>Fig. 48.</p>
<img src="images/fig048.png" width="360" height="72" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>If the fracture does not come to the surface, it becomes a
<i>cavern</i>. In limestone, caverns which are formed in this way are
very frequent, and extend for many miles. There is generally a
stream of water running through them, but not of sufficient volume
to have produced the erosion which has been effected.</p>

<p>When the sides of the fracture are but little separated, some
mineral often separates itself from the adjacent rock, and filling up
the space, reunites the broken parts. It is then called a <i>vein of
segregation</i> (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>, <i>a b</i>). But the fracture is more frequently
filled with some volcanic rock injected from below. It is then a
<i>dike</i> (<i>c</i> <i>d</i>), and may have a width of many rods, though it often
diminishes in width till it is a mere thread. A dike of which the
injected material is a metallic ore is a <i>mineral vein</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 395px;">

<img src="images/fig049.png" width="395" height="157" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>4. The uplifting force by which the fracture is produced has
frequently raised the rock on one side higher than it has on the
other. This is called a <i>fault</i>. (<a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50.</a> The unequal movements
by which the fault is produced seem in some instances to
have been repeated several times, and the grinding of the broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
edges upon each other has polished and striated the sides of the
fracture.</p>

<div class="fig_center">

</div>

<p>5. Sedimentary rocks are often found with the planes of their
strata more or less <i>inclined</i>. It is evident that they were not
thus formed. The depositions of sediment from water will always
be horizontal, or, at most, only slightly inclined. But there is
often evidence in the rock itself that
its strata were once horizontal. It
is frequently observed that vertical
strata contain pebbles with their
longer axes in the plane of the strata.
(<a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51.</a> When these pebbles were
deposited, the longer axes would take,
on an obvious mechanical principle,
a horizontal position. Their present vertical position must have
resulted from a change in the position of the strata in which they
are enclosed. The same thing is shown by the position of a petrified
forest in the south of England, known as the Portland dirt-bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Some parts of it are inclined at an angle of forty-five
degrees. The position of the vegetable remains (<a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a>) shows
that when they were growing the surface was horizontal.</p>

<p>The line <i>b d</i> (<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>), on inclined strata which makes with the
horizon the greatest angle, is called the <i>direction of the dip</i>. The
angle thus formed (<i>a b d</i>) is the <i>angle of inclination</i>. When
inclined strata come to the surface, the exposed edge, <i>b c</i>, is the
<i>outcrop</i>, and the line of outcrop on a horizontal surface is called
the <i>strike</i> of the strata.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 399px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_53" id="Fig_53"></a>Fig. 53.</p>
<img src="images/fig053.png" width="399" height="193" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the inclined position is produced by an uplift of the
strata, along a given line, so that they dip in opposite directions,
this line is called an <i>anticlinal axis</i>, as at <a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>. If, however,
the strata are fractured along this line, as at <i>b</i>, the fracture
becomes a <i>valley of elevation</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 381px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_54" id="Fig_54"></a>Fig. 54.</p>
<img src="images/fig054.png" width="381" height="190" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>If depression take place along a given line, as at <i>c</i>, the strata
will dip towards this line, and it will be a <i>synclinal axis</i>. The
depression will be a <i>valley of subsidence</i>. A synclinal axis
would also be produced by an elevation of the strata, as at <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>,
on each side of it, and the valley thus produced is one of elevation.</p>

<p>When successive sets of strata, as <i>f</i> and <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>, are not
parallel, they are said to be <i>unconformable</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 375px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_55" id="Fig_55"></a>Fig. 55.</p>

<img src="images/fig056.png" width="295" height="175" alt="" />
</div>

<p>6. When the strata are subjected to displacement, they do not
always take a merely inclined position, but are often <i>contorted</i>
(<a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>), or folded together (<a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>). These <i>folded axes</i> frequently
succeed each other for many miles. (See Figs. <a href="#Fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#Fig_82">82</a>.)
In the case represented by <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>, if the highest portion
has been removed, so that the line <i>a b</i> represents the actual surface,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
we shall have apparently a succession of deposits, of which
those at <i>b</i> would be the newest, and the oldest would be found at
<i>a</i>, when in fact the strata at the extremities are parts of the same
layer.</p>

<p>It is probable that disturbances like those now mentioned have
been taking place continually, in different places, from the earliest
times. There have been no periods of universal disturbance, and
none of universal repose. On the contrary, the periods of disturbance
in one part of the world have been periods of repose in
another. For example, the coal measures of Europe were much
broken and disturbed before the deposition of the new red sandstone,
and the close of the coal period was at one time supposed to
have been a period of general convulsion. It is now ascertained
that the principal coal-fields in this country were not much disturbed
at that period, and have not been since.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="III_CHANGES_OF_ELEVATION" id="III_CHANGES_OF_ELEVATION"></a>
SECTION III.&mdash;CHANGES OF ELEVATION AND SUBSIDENCE.</p>

<p>The continents, if we except the more rugged and broken
portions, rise from the sea with an almost imperceptible ascent;
and even the mountains have a much gentler slope than we are
apt to suppose, so that a section of the earth parallel to the equator
would be almost a perfect circle. The slope of a mountain,
from its base to its highest point, rarely forms with the horizon an
angle of as much as twelve degrees. In the following figure (<a href="#Fig_57">57</a>),
A represents the peak of Chimborazo, B of Teneriffe, C of √Ütna,
and D of Mount Loa, the principal volcano of the Sandwich
Islands. The highest mountains would be represented on a twelve-inch
globe by an altitude of less than the one-hundredth of an
inch above the level of the sea. But the rising and sinking of
these masses, though so small compared with the dimensions of the
earth, are yet geological changes on the largest scale.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Elevation of Mountains.</i>&mdash;Mountains have formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
been covered with the waters of the ocean. This is evident, in the
case of some mountains, from the existence of stratified rocks
reaching to the summits. The stratification could have been produced
only by deposition from water. It is, moreover, evident
from the existence of marine fossils, distributed through these
strata, so abundantly, that they cannot be accounted for on any
other hypothesis than that the animals lived and died where the
remains of them are now found. These strata must therefore have
formed the bed of the sea while the fossils were accumulating.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 303px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_57" id="Fig_57"></a>Fig. 57.</p>
<img src="images/fig057.png" width="303" height="219" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is no <i>direct</i> evidence that the granitic mountain peaks
were ever submerged. But there is reason for believing that
the sedimentary strata which now occupy the lower slopes were, at
the time of their deposition, continuous,&mdash;the igneous rock having
subsequently broken through them,&mdash;so that the waters of the ocean
once rested on the whole area which the mountain now occupies!</p>

<p>If the ocean could ever have been above its present level sufficiently
to have covered all the sedimentary rocks, we might
assume that the height of mountains has not been changed. But
the level of the ocean cannot be subject to much variation. The
total amount of water on the globe is always the same. If the
continents and mountains were all submerged at once, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
waters were expanded by the highest temperature consistent with
the liquid form, there would not be a change of level of more than
two hundred and fifty feet. We may assume, then, that the ocean
level has always been essentially the same that it now is. We
must therefore conclude that the sedimentary rocks, and the mountains
of which they form a part, have been elevated to their
present position from the bed of the sea.</p>

<p>Different mountain ranges have been elevated at different
periods. The silurian and carboniferous formations were deposited
before the Alleghany Mountains, which they contributed to
form, were elevated; while the new red sandstone and the cretaceous
and tertiary formations were deposited subsequently to the
upheaval. They are accordingly found at the base of the range,
nearly horizontal, and have risen above the level of the ocean only
as the continent generally has risen. The Pyrenees were elevated
after the deposition of the cretaceous rocks, and have carried them
up so that they appear at a high angle, while the tertiary rocks
at the base are horizontal, as in the United States. The Andes
have carried up the tertiary rocks with them, and their elevation
must therefore belong to a recent period. It appears that they
are even yet rising.</p>

<p>It has recently been shown that the Alps have been subjected
to upheaval at several distinct periods. At the close of the silurian
period they formed a cluster of islands. At the commencement
of the tertiary period they became a mountain range, and
at the close of that period they were thrown up some two thousand
feet higher, to their present position. Nearly the same things will
probably be found true of other mountain ranges, when their structure
has been minutely studied.</p>

<p>The elevation of contiguous parallel ridges will necessarily leave
intervening <i>valleys of elevation</i>. As mountain ranges generally
consist of several such ridges, valleys of this description are
numerous, and they are often of great extent.</p>

<p>It is obvious that there are mountains in the sea of as great
height above the lowest valleys as the mountains of continents are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
above the level of the sea. If a new continent should hereafter
be formed by the elevation of a large area of the bed of the sea,
the existing mountains, now appearing in the form of islands,
would partake of the general movement, and the new continent
would have the same general diversities of surface as existing continents.
The mountains would have existed long before the continent.
It is therefore to be supposed that the mountains of the
present continents were elevated before the continents, and that
they stood for long periods as islands, exposed to the action of
waves, tides, and marine currents.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Elevation of Continents.</i>&mdash;Continents have been elevated
by so slow a movement that it has not generally been perceived, even
when they have been peopled by nations advanced in civilization.
And yet satisfactory evidence is always left of former sea-levels.</p>

<p>Almost every seaboard furnishes examples of beaches, evidently
once washed by the sea, but now elevated more or less above high
water.</p>

<p>At Lubec, near the northern extremity of the coast of Maine,
barnacles<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> are found attached to the rocks eighteen feet above high
water. The pilots at that place, and for a hundred miles north
and south of it, speak of the ship-channels as diminishing in depth,
though it is certain that they are not filling up. Such facts are
to be explained only by supposing that the coast is rising.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The barnacle is a marine animal, permanently fixed to the rocks, and
live but a short time without being surrounded by sea-water.</p></div>

<p>Lakes are numerous throughout the northern portions of North
America, which are receiving annually large quantities of sediment,
and must ultimately become alluvial plains. Those of moderate
depth, as Lake Erie, cannot require periods very protracted
to fill them. Their continuance in such abundance indicates that
the elevation of the continent to its present height is comparatively
recent. This conclusion is confirmed by evidence of another
kind. Throughout this region of lakes, beds of clay containing
the remains of existing species of marine animals, are found at all
elevations from the sea-coast, to the height of about four hundred
feet, but not higher. These clay beds are very recent, and were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
deposited when the surface was four hundred or five hundred feet
lower than it now is; and this amount of elevation has left the
existing lakes scattered over the surface.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> &ldquo;It is remarkable that on the shores of the great lakes there are certain
plants the proper station of which is the immediate neighborhood of the ocean,
as if they had constituted part of the early flora of those regions when the
lakes were filled with salt water, and have survived the change that has taken
place in the physical conditions of their soil.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Torrey&rsquo;s Flora of the State of

<p>The whole southern part of South America, embracing an area
equal to that of Europe, has been elevated within a very recent
period; and some parts of it, if not all of it, are still rising. The
shells found on the plains from Brazil to Terra del Fuego, and on
the Pacific coast, at a height of from one hundred to thirteen hundred
feet, are identical with those now inhabiting the adjacent seas.
And &ldquo;besides the organic remains, there are, in very many parts,
marks of erosion, caves, ancient beaches, sand-dunes, and successive
terraces of gravel,&rdquo; all which must have resulted from the action
of the waves at a period not remote. At Lima, articles of human
skill peculiar to the original inhabitants of Peru were found imbedded
in a mass of sea-shells eighty-three feet above the present
sea level. The elevation on the Pacific coast has been in part by
sudden uplifts of a few feet at a time; but it is found, from time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to time, that there has been a change of level, amounting to a foot
or more in a year, when there have been none of these sudden
movements.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of Europe, reaching from North Cape in
Norway to near the southern part of Sweden, more than a thousand
miles, and from the Atlantic to St. Petersburg, more than
six hundred miles, has been rising at the rate of about three feet
in a century, for at least two centuries, and probably much longer.
This change is proved by the occurrence, at considerable elevations
above the sea, of shells now found in the Baltic; by rocks once
sunken, now raised above the surface of the sea, and by ancient
seaports having become inland towns. To determine the truth by
actual measurement, the Royal Academy of Stockholm, about
thirty-five years since, caused marks to be cut in the rocks along
the coast, to indicate the ordinary level of the water. This is
easily ascertained, as the Baltic is nearly a tideless sea. The present
level of the sea, compared with that indicated by the marks
before mentioned, leaves no doubt that the country is rising.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Subsidence of Land.</i>&mdash;Elevations can be shown to
have taken place by fossils, and by other evidences of former sea
levels which are left on the surface; but depressions leave but few
indications of change of level. It is yet doubtful whether the
depression is equal to the elevation; that is, whether the amount
of land remains nearly constant, or whether there has been an
augmentation of the dry land within the tertiary and recent periods.
We are certain that the augmentation, if any, has not been
equal to the elevation, for subsidences to a great amount are known
to have taken place.</p>

<p>There are occasional instances of submerged forests seen at low
tide, at some distance from the shore. There are several near the
coast of England and Scotland, and near the coast of Massachusetts.
They are but a few feet below low water, and do not indicate
a subsidence of more than about twenty feet.</p>

<p>Numerous instances are on record of the sinking down of
wharfs and buildings near the sea during earthquakes. Almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
every violent earthquake is accompanied by a change of level. The
changes of this kind which have been noticed are in seaport towns,
because greater facilities are there afforded for detecting them, and
because loss of property awakens attention to them; but there is
every reason to suppose
that these changes
of level extend to great
distances both into the
country and into the
sea.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 562px;">

<p>An immense area
in the Indian and Pacific
Oceans, probably
ten millions of square
miles, is undergoing
change of level. The
lines A B and D G
(<a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>) represent
nearly the axes of depression;
while an intermediate
and two
exterior parallel lines
would represent axes
of elevation. The evidence
of these changes
is found principally in
the peculiarities of the
wall of coral rock encircling
the islands.</p>

<p>The following figures
represent, in sections,
modifications of
form of the same island.
The coral wall
built up around the island by the polyps, from the depth of fifty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
or at most of a hundred feet, is shown at <i>c c</i> (<a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>). If the
island is elevated, this wall becomes a <i>fringing reef</i> (<a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>), <i>b&#8242;</i>
becoming the level of the sea, and the animal begins a new wall
at the same depth as before. But if the island is gradually sinking,
the wall is kept built up to the surface, and becomes a <i>barrier
reef</i> (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>). A channel is thus left between the island and the
reef, which, though
gradually filling up
with broken coral or
other sediment, is generally
deep enough for
a ship-channel. If
the island continue to
subside till it disappears,
and the coral wall is still kept at the surface, it then becomes
an <i>atoll</i>, a circular coral island (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>), often of many leagues
in diameter, beaten by the surf on the outer edge, but enclosing a
quiet lake, which communicates only by occasional channels with
the ocean.</p>

<p>The islands contiguous to the lines A B and C D (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>) are
uniformly atolls, or are surrounded by barrier reefs, and are therefore
subsiding; while the islands at a distance from these lines
are surrounded by fringing reefs, which indicate that they are
rising.</p>

<p>A well-authenticated instance of gradual subsidence is that of
Greenland. The entire western coast, from its southern extremity
to Disco Island, a distance of six hundred miles, has for the last
two centuries been slowly subsiding. The dwelling-houses and
places of worship built by the early European settlers are now in
part or entirely submerged. The natives are said to be aware of
the subsidence, and never build their huts near the sea.</p>

<p>4. We have thus seen that both elevation and depression may
take place. There is reason to believe that these changes of level
have, in some cases, been several times repeated. In one of the
eastern ranges of the Andes, opposite to Chili, there is a mass of
marine strata of five thousand feet in thickness. About the middle
of the series there occurs a silicified forest. In one place a
clump of coniferous trees was found of more than fifty in number,
and a foot or more in diameter. The base of the strata must have
been twenty-five hundred feet below the surface of the sea, in
order to admit of the deposition of the first half of it. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
then elevated, so that a forest grew upon its surface. It was then
depressed at least twenty-five hundred feet, more, to admit of the
deposition of the subsequent strata, and the whole is now uplifted
to form a mountain range of eight thousand feet in height.</p>

</div>

<p>The temple of Jupiter Serapis, near Naples, in Italy, was built
near the sea, about eighteen hundred years ago. It was gradually
submerged, and finally lost by the deposition of sediment nearly
to the top of the columns. It was afterwards elevated, so as to be
entirely above the level of the sea. The remains of the temple
(<a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>) were afterwards discovered by the columns projecting a
little above the ground. The sediment was removed to the depth
of forty-six feet, when the workmen came to the base of the columns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and to a pavement seventy feet in diameter. In 1807 an
artist was employed to take drawings of the ruin. The pavement
was then above the level of the sea. Sixteen years afterwards the
same artist found the pavement covered with water, and the depth
has continued to increase since that time. It is considered that
for the last forty years the depression has been three-fourths of an
inch a year.</p>

<p>Instances enough have now been given to show how extensively
the system admits of change. They are sufficient to justify us in
searching for indications of great revolutions in past times, even
where no such indications have as yet been discovered. They will
serve as a key to many otherwise inexplicable phenomena, In
order to the interpretation of such phenomena readily, we must
cease to look upon these as exceptional cases, and regard them not
only as facts, but as facts of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>From the examples which have now been given, as well as from
speculations upon the cause of these changes, it seems highly probable
that all the surface of the solid portion of the earth, whether
land or the bed of the sea, is undergoing changes of level. It may
be so gradual that in the life of an individual it would be imperceptible,
even where the best means of detecting it exist. These
means are generally the works of man, and they are themselves so
liable to change, that it would be scarcely possible to detect variations
of level, which amount to but a few inches in a century.</p>

<p>If we admit that the relations of land and water have always
been variable, it is impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion as
to the amount, position or form, of the dry land at any former
period. We may determine, with some degree of certainty, what
portions of the present continents were submerged at particular
epochs. Thus, we may infer that most of this country was submerged
during the silurian period, from the great extent of the
Silurian rocks; and, from the limited extent of the chalk formation
in this country, we know that during the cretaceous period most of
the continent was above the surface of the sea. But we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
absolutely no data for determining what portions of the bed of the
sea were at any time dry land.</p>

<p>It is supposable that the land has been principally confined to
the equatorial regions at one period, and to the polar at another.
At still a different period the land may have existed as islands
scattered through a general ocean. These relations may, therefore,
be assumed to have existed, if there are geological phenomena
which best accord with such relations.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="IV_CHANGES_ON_SURFACE" id="IV_CHANGES_ON_SURFACE"></a>
SECTION IV.&mdash;CHANGES ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.</p>

<p>1. The principal changes of this class consist in the wearing
down and removing immense quantities of the surface rock. The
form in which the <i>igneous rocks</i>, of which the entire crust of the
earth was originally composed, now appear, furnishes no assistance
in judging of the amount of denudation which they have suffered.
We can judge only from the amount of rock for which they have
furnished the materials, and these are the whole sedimentary
series which exist both as dry land and as the bed of the sea.</p>

<p>2. The <i>sedimentary rocks</i> have also been subject to great denudation;
and we often have, in what is left, some indications of
how much has been removed. One of these indications consists in
the now level surface of those portions of country in which large
<i>faults</i> exist. By the excavations for coal, in England, faults have
been discovered of five or six hundred feet. At the time that they
were formed, the surface must have presented precipitous escarpments
(as represented by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>) of a height
equal to the dislocation; but the whole is now reduced to a general
level (<i>z z</i>), denuding causes having removed the elevated
portions.</p>

<p>The extent of <i>valleys</i> will often give some idea of the amount
of denudation to which a region has been subjected. In the north-west
of Scotland there is a succession of hills of about three thousand
feet in elevation, consisting, for the upper two thousand feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of horizontal strata of old red sandstone. (<a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66.</a> We cannot
conceive that these mountain masses were deposited in their
present isolated form. The whole intervening spaces must have
been filled with strata continuous with those by which the elevations
are formed.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> &ldquo;I entertain little doubt that when this loftier portion of Scotland, including
the entire Highlands, first presented its broad back over the waves, the
upper surface consisted exclusively, from one extremity to the other, of a continuous
tract of old red sandstone; though, ere the land finally emerged, the
ocean currents of ages had swept it away, all except in the lower and last
raised borders, and in detached localities where it still remains, as in the pyramidal
hills of Western Rosshire, to show the amazing depth to which it had
once overlaid the inferior rocks.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Miller, Old Red Sandstone</i>, <i>p. 22</i>.</p></div>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 367px;">

<img src="images/fig067.png" width="448" height="222" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A somewhat similar instance occurs in the Connecticut river
sandstone, in the central part of Massachusetts. The following
figure (<a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>) represents two mountains of 1 the sandstone, between
which the Connecticut river flows. The dotted lines indicate a
depth of one thousand feet of the rock which has been swept away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
It is also thought that a bed of equal depth has been removed from
this section southward, through the State of Connecticut, to the
sea-coast.</p>

<p>3. <i>Valleys</i>, and even many of the larger valleys, are produced
by the wearing down of the surface. The lower portion of the
Connecticut valley is one of denudation, though in its upper part
it is a valley of elevation, resulting from the upheaval of the
Green and White Mountains. The water-courses from the mountains
are transverse to the direction of the ranges, and generally
consist of valleys of denudation. These valleys were no doubt
originally fractures, produced while the mountains were rising.
The fractures have been subsequently widened by denudation into
valleys.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 288px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_68" id="Fig_68"></a>Fig. 68.</p>
<img src="images/fig068.png" width="288" height="224" alt="" />
</div>

<p>4. The rocky surface, beyond the fortieth parallels of latitude,
and in the vicinity of glacier-producing mountains, is generally
covered with
<i>grooves</i> and <i>stri√¶</i>
(<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>), varying
from several inches
in depth to the
finest perceptible
lines. Rocks that
are of a soft consistence,
or which
have been long
exposed to atmospheric
agents, seldom
exhibit these
marks, though there are probably few places, outside of the parallels
before mentioned, where the rocky surface, if it has been
protected from atmospheric decay, does not contain such grooving.</p>

<p>5. Another change at the surface consists in the formation of a
<i>soil</i>; that is, of a superficial layer, of no great thickness, of earthy
matter, a large proportion of which is always in a minutely divided
state. In some instances it is common sediment, unsolidified; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
others, it consists of the surface rock in a state of disintegration;
but a large part of the soil within the region where the grooved
surfaces are found consists of materials transported from a
distance.</p>

<p>Soils are distinguished according to their predominant minerals,
as siliceous, aluminous and calcareous. If siliceous matter is in
excess, it will be a light, warm soil, and allow the water to pass
through it too freely. If the clay predominates, the soil is cold,
stiff, and too retentive of moisture. A proper admixture of these
three ingredients constitutes the best soils. There are some other
mineral ingredients essential to the productiveness of soils, but
they are always in small proportion. In addition to the inorganic
part which is common to the upper soil, and the subsoil, there is
required, in order to render the upper layer productive, a large
admixture of decaying animal and vegetable matter.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="V_CHANGES_OF_CLIMATE" id="V_CHANGES_OF_CLIMATE"></a>
SECTION V.&mdash;CHANGES OF CLIMATE.</p>

<p>Our means of determining the climate of any former period
consists in a comparison of the fossils of such period with the existing
forms of life in warm and cold climates.</p>

<p>The earliest abundant <i>vegetation</i> consisted principally of ferns,
rushes and mosses, and a larger growth was attained than is attained
by any of the allied forms of the present time. We may
infer that the circumstances under which these lower forms of
vegetable life are now produced in the largest proportion, compared
with other forms, and under which they grow to the largest size, are
the circumstances approaching most nearly those under which the
early vegetation was produced. These circumstances are found
to be a position elevated but little above the level of the sea, a
humid atmosphere, and the highest terrestrial temperature. Such
facts favor the conclusion that during the coal period an ultra-tropical
climate prevailed, and that the land existed in the form
of low islands, thickly set in a general ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The peculiar characters of some of the <i>animal fossils</i>, from the
earliest fossiliferous to the tertiary series, indicate that a warmer
climate prevailed during their formation than now exists. The
remains of marine animals, such as the cephalopoda, are found in
great numbers and in high latitudes, in a fossil state; but similar
species, as the nautilus, now abound only between the tropics. The
same is true of the crinoidea. Coralline limestone is also found in
great abundance and in high northern latitudes; but the stone-producing
coral now exists only in very warm seas. The remains of
saurian reptiles are numerous in the o√∂lite and Wealden; but all the
larger recent species of the lizard tribe, such as the crocodile, are
confined to the warmer regions of the earth.</p>

<p>A former warm climate in Siberia is indicated by the occurrence
there of the remains of elephants. These animals were so
abundant that their tusks are now collected as an article of commerce.
The abundance and high state of preservation of these
remains seem to preclude the explanation that they were conveyed
there, from the present tropical regions, by any great geological
convulsion. The species must therefore have inhabited the country,
though the elephant is now found only between the tropics. The
Siberian elephant was a different species from any now existing,
and, unlike the recent species, had a covering of coarse hair.
There is, however, no reason to conclude that it could endure a
continued low temperature; and its sustenance would have been
impossible, from the very stinted vegetation which that region now
affords. We must therefore suppose that Siberia enjoyed, at the
period when it supported these animals in such abundance, a tropical
climate.</p>

<p>Most of the facts which go to prove a change of climate have
been observed in the northern hemisphere; but the explorations in
South America and New Holland furnish ground for believing that
the geological phenomena of the two hemispheres are essentially
alike, and that the indications of climate are the same for the same
periods.</p>

<p>Such is, in general, the evidence in reference to climate; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
leads to the conclusion that a highly tropical climate prevailed in
the temperate, and for some distance, at least, into the polar
zones, in the early geological periods; while there is no reason for
supposing that the tropical regions experienced a temperature too
high for physical life to endure it. The climate of the earth was
characterized then by a higher temperature than now, and by
greater uniformity. This was the climate, with perhaps a gradual
reduction of temperature, till the later portions of the tertiary
period.</p>

<p>Before the close of the tertiary period, a change occurred, and
probably a rapid one, to a more rigorous climate than now exists.
The destruction of the elephant in Siberia was evidently sudden,
and was followed by extreme cold; for the animals are in some
cases entirely preserved in ice, and in so perfect a state that, when
the ice which surrounds them becomes melted, the flesh is devoured
by carnivorous animals. There are occasionally found, in the drift
of the boulder period, shells similar to those of the Arctic regions,
and in a condition to show that they have not been transported.
The clay beds of the northern portion of the United States and of
Canada were deposited during the last depression of that portion
of the continent, and they contain the remains of marine animals
identical in several instances with species now living, but confined
to more northern regions. It must therefore be admitted that the
interval between the middle tertiary and the modern era was one
of great cold. It is generally referred to as the <i>Glacial period</i>.</p>

<p>Very considerable local changes of climate have also occurred
within the historical period. Thus the mean temperature of the
Alps has been so reduced that the ancient passes have in modern
times become choked up with snow, and other passes have been
sought,&mdash;a result, perhaps, of additional upheaval. It would seem
that Siberia is now receiving a milder climate. The ice in which
elephants have for centuries been imbedded has been slowly melting
for at least thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="VI_ADVANTAGES" id="VI_ADVANTAGES"></a>
SECTION VI.&mdash;ADVANTAGES RESULTING FROM GEOLOGICAL CHANGES.</p>

<p>1. The division of the general surface into land and water, as well
as the diversified form of the land, the existence of mountains and
low lands, and the consequent modifications of climate, the waterfalls,
and the river-systems, constituting the drainage of continents,
are all results of the process of upheaval.</p>

<p>2. A large part of the mineral substances employed for architectural
and economical purposes are oceanic deposits, such as the
marbles, slates, sandstones and mineral salt, and would have been
inaccessible if they had not been elevated from the position in
which they were formed. And the elevation of them above the
bed of the sea would have exposed only the superficial layer, if
they had not been either irregularly uplifted, as at <i>e c</i> (<a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>),
or unequally worn down, as at <i>b</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 421px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_69" id="Fig_69"></a>Fig. 69.</p>
<img src="images/fig069.png" width="421" height="214" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The granitic rocks, as they were formed below the aqueous
rocks, must have remained unknown and useless, if they had not
been brought to the surface, as at <i>c</i>, by the most convulsive efforts
of nature of which we have any knowledge. Thus, natural
mechanical forces have effected for man what the mechanical forces
under his control would be entirely insufficient to accomplish.</p>

<p>3. It is by changes of this kind that we become acquainted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the geological structure of the crust of the earth. Mining operations
have never extended to a greater depth than three thousand
feet, while the inclined position of the strata exposes for
examination, along their outcropping edges, <i>e a c</i>, the whole series,
even to the primary rocks. The upheaval of the granitic rocks,
and the removal by denudation of the overlying deposits, shows
us the crystalline character which the earthy materials take,
when subjected to pressure and cooled from fusion with extreme
slowness. Thus we have, exposed to observation, the process of
nature in the formation and modification of rocks for several miles
in depth. Of the central portions, however, including by far the
largest part of the mass of the earth, we have no knowledge
whatever.</p>

<p>4. <i>Springs</i>, and the other means of obtaining water for domestic
purposes, depend in part upon the inclined position of strata,
and the broken and uneven condition of the surface, and in part
upon the alternation of permeable and impermeable strata. If all
the strata were porous, like the sandstones, the water which falls
upon the surface would gradually settle through them to the level
of the sea; or, if they were all impermeable, like the clays, the
water would pass over the surface, and be collected in lakes or the
ocean. As it is, the porous structure of the soil and of some rocks
acts as a reservoir, from which the water is gradually discharged,
and the intervention of impermeable strata prevents its taking a
perpendicular direction downwards. Thus, if the stratum <i>e b</i>
(<a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>) consists of porous rock, and the one below is impermeable, the
water which is absorbed at <i>e</i> will appear at <i>b</i> as a spring. Or,
if the line <i>a d</i> is a fracture, the water received at c may reappear
as a spring at <i>a</i>. If the strata were perforated by boring at <i>e</i> till
the porous stratum <i>a</i> is reached, the water will rise to the surface,
constituting an <i>Artesian well</i>. An ordinary well consists of
an excavation continued till a stratum is reached which is permanently
saturated with water.</p>

<p>5. Most of the <i>metallic ores</i> which occur in the stratified rocks,
with the exception of iron, are found in fractures or as dikes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Without these disturbances of the strata, the ores would have
remained either sparingly diffused throughout the adjacent strata,
or as a part of the melted mass at the volcanic centres. The ores
and metals which are found in the primary rocks are accessible
only by the bringing up of these rocks to the surface.</p>

<p>The fracturing, displacement, and elevation of the strata,
attended, as is often the case, with the destruction of property and
of the life both of man and the inferior animals, might, at first
view, be thought an unnecessary, if not a wanton infringement upon
arrangements already established. But the results which we have
noticed, though by no means a full enumeration of the advantages
resulting from geological changes, are sufficient to show that even
the more violent disturbances to which the crust of the earth has
been subjected constitute an important part of that series of adjustments
which has rendered it a suitable abode for human beings.
These changes are therefore neither useless nor accidental, but are
essential parts of a wise and beneficent system.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="caption2">OF THE CAUSES OF GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.</p>


<p>An exhibition of the <i>composition and structure of the earth</i>,
together with an account, as far as there is reliable evidence, of
the modifications which they have undergone, has been the object
of the preceding chapters. They are mainly a collection and classification
of observed facts. No reference has been made to
causes or modes of operation, except in a few cases where it was
necessary in order that a statement or description, might be
intelligible.</p>

<p>If the facts have been given with sufficient clearness and detail
to convey a correct general idea of the crust of the earth, we are
prepared to inquire what are the agencies employed, and how they
have operated in producing it. It is the province of the geologist
to question every known power in nature, and to ascertain what
geological effects each one is now producing; and, observing what
effects are produced by given causes, he is to judge of the causes
which have produced like effects in past geological periods.</p>

<p>Some of these causes are in their nature limited, and effects can
be referred to them only within those limits. Thus, the congelation
of water expands it by a certain proportion of its volume, and
beyond that it can have no effect. But the expansive power of
steam varies with the temperature; and hence the effects referred
to it may be equally varied. Thus, we are not to expect exact
uniformity of results in all past times, but <i>the results will vary
only as the circumstances vary</i> upon which the operation of these
causes depends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Geological causes, in most instances, operate with extreme slowness;
and therefore it will require a series of observations, continued
for a long time, to ascertain what are the capabilities of these
causes. But a single instance of their effects proves their capabilities
thus far. Hence, one instance of the deposition of a
stratum of salt in a salt lake; of the filling of a fracture with fluid
lava; of a volcanic eruption, like that of Iceland in 1783; of the
subsidence of a volcanic mountain, as that of Papandayang in
Java; or of the rising of a large area of land, as in Sweden, as
fully proves that natural causes exist capable of producing these
effects, as if the effects were produced daily. As these effects
increase in number, and careful observations are made and authentic
accounts preserved, the means of correctly explaining geological
phenomena will increase. The causes thus far known are
Atmospheric Causes, Chemical Action, Organic Agency, and
Aqueous, Aqueo-glacial and Igneous Action.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="I_ATMOSPHERIC_CAUSES" id="I_ATMOSPHERIC_CAUSES"></a>
SECTION I.&mdash;ATMOSPHERIC CAUSES.</p>

<p>The oxygen of the atmosphere is capable of uniting with some
of the constituents of rocks, by which their cohesion is weakened or
destroyed. This is the cause of the rapid disintegration of some
varieties of granite. The protoxide of iron which they contain is
converted, by contact with the atmosphere, into the peroxide. Its
volume is thus increased, and portions of the rock are separated
from the mass. When granite or limestone contains sulphuret of
iron, the oxygen of the atmosphere, in connection with moisture,
combines with the sulphur, forming sulphuric acid, by which limestone
and the felspar of granite are rapidly decomposed. Hence,
a rock which contains an oxide or sulphuret of iron should not be
used for architectural purposes.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid is another constituent of the atmosphere which
operates as a decomposing agent. The water that falls from the
atmosphere is charged with it, and thus becomes capable of dissolving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
calcareous rocks. Carbonic acid is thus indirectly the
means of the rapid destruction of rocks of this class. It is also
believed that carbonic acid enters into direct combination with
some of the constituents of rocks, and particularly felspar; for it is
found that in those countries where carbonic acid issues in great
quantities from the earth, the rocks, especially those which contain
felspar, disintegrate rapidly. Masses of many tons&rsquo; weight, which
appear to be solid granite, after being broken are found to be in
such a state of decay that fragments may be reduced to sand
between the fingers.</p>

<p>The moisture of the atmosphere has some effect as a decomposing
agent. Rocks which are exposed to frequent alternations of
moisture and dryness soon crumble into fragments. Rain, falling
upon the surface of rock, produces, mechanically, a destroying
effect, which is not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>Variations of temperature, especially those alternations above
and below the freezing point, have greater influence than any
other cause in the destruction of rocks. When the water with
which a rock is saturated congeals, the resulting expansion tends
to enlarge the interstices, and thus to separate the particles of the
rock. When the ice melts, the particles fail to resume the closeness
of arrangement with which they were before packed. By
frequent repetition of this action, the superficial portion loses its
cohesion, and disintegrates. It is also found that in the region of
perpetual snow the surface of the mountain masses is covered with
rock in a disintegrated or fragmentary state, in greater abundance
than below the snow line; but no explanation of this fact has yet
been found.</p>

<p>In mountainous regions, electrical discharges and violent storms
have some destroying effect. Winds have considerable power
in changing the place of earthy matter in a disintegrated state.
In deserts, the sands are carried in great quantities to great
distances.</p>

<p>The causes now enumerated, when considered separately, and as
acting for only limited periods of time, seem hardly worthy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
notice; but when considered as operating conjointly, and for indefinite
periods of time, they must have produced important changes
on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>From these causes, the surface and ornaments of castles and
other ancient edifices, and of boulders, and all insulated rocks,
are found to be decayed, and often to a considerable depth. It is
from these causes that a soil is produced on every surface of rock
which is not so exposed to the action of currents that the debris is
removed as fast as it is formed. Hence it is, also, that a slope of
detritus is formed at the base of every declivity, so that the ledge
appears only at the highest points.</p>

<p>It is from a combination of these atmospheric causes that a large
part of the sediment is furnished which brooks and rivers carry
away. And when cohesion is not entirely overcome, it is so far
weakened that other causes are much more effectual than they
would otherwise be, in effecting the disintegration of rocks.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="II_CHEMICAL_ACTION" id="II_CHEMICAL_ACTION"></a>
SECTION II.&mdash;CHEMICAL ACTION.</p>

<p>All those changes in which the action is molecular,&mdash;that is, between
the molecules as such, and not between the masses,&mdash;including
the effects of the imponderable substances, we regard as resulting
from chemical agency.</p>

<p>Under the control of these molecular forces the crystalline rocks
have taken their form; and if the crust of the earth could have
remained in a fixed condition, in which these forces would have
been in equilibrium, no further chemical action could have taken
place. But, instead of being in a fixed condition, the present system
is one of perpetual change. Various disturbances of this
equilibrium of forces,&mdash;such, for instance, as the diurnal and annual
changes of temperature at the surface, and the still greater secular
changes of temperature at great depths,&mdash;will bring the chemical
forces into operation. The mechanical disintegration of the crystalline
rocks, and the deposition of them in strata independently of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the chemical affinity of their particles, will give occasion for
chemical changes,&mdash;that is, for a rearrangement of the particles in
accordance with their affinities,&mdash;whenever any movement of the
particles among themselves can take place. These movements take
place, to a very great extent, under the influence of electrical currents,
and of change of temperature, even while the masses retain
their solid form.</p>

<p>Chemical affinity has exhibited itself on the largest scale in the
formation of the various mineral species of which the crust of the
earth is composed; but we may also refer to the same cause the
formation of divisional planes in rocks, the concretionary arrangement,
and mineral veins.</p>

<p>1. <i>Divisional Planes.</i>&mdash;It has before been stated, that the older
rocks, in many cases, cleave freely in planes not parallel with the
stratification. (See <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>.) In some instances, in beds of lava,
a similar cleavage exists, sufficiently perfect to allow of its use as
a roofing material. In these cases, there must have been a rearrangement
of the particles, so that their axes of greatest attraction
would lie in parallel planes; the same arrangement which exists in
mica and other crystalline substances, which have one and but one
free cleavage.</p>

<p>A similar arrangement has sometimes taken place under such
circumstances as to submit the process to more careful scrutiny.
In the gold mines of Chili, the powder from which the gold has
been washed is &ldquo;thrown into a common heap. A great deal of
chemical action then commences; salts of various kinds effloresce
on the surface, and the mass becomes hard, and divides into fragments
which possess <i>an even and well-defined slaty structure</i>.&rdquo;
When a portion of clay, worked into a paste with a very weak
acid, is submitted to a weak voltaic action for several months, and
then dried, it is found to have acquired a distinct though imperfect
cleavage structure.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that both electrical currents and ordinary
chemical action are capable of arranging the particles of an earthy
mass into separable layers. We may then regard this change in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
older rocks as an imperfect crystallization, and probably induced
by electro-chemical agency.</p>

<p>It is also found that all rocks are divided into huge blocks by
seams not parallel with the cleavage, and too regular to be considered
as fractures. These seams bear an analogy to the secondary
faces of crystals, which are never parallel to the cleavage.</p>

<p>2. <i>Concretionary Formations.</i>&mdash;There exist in many rocks
concretions which differ from the mass of the rocks. In most of
the tertiary clays there are small concretionary nodules, which
contain more calcareous matter than the mass of clay around them.
In the coal formation, the nodular iron ore consists of concretionary
masses. In the chalk formation, nodules of flint abound, and generally
in layers. In many of these cases, particularly in the
clays and coal, the nodules have an organic nucleus, and, although
concretionary, they retain the marks of stratification of the adjacent
rocks. Hence they could not have been deposited in the form
of nodules. There must therefore have been in the rock, though
in the solid state, such motion among the molecules that particles
of a particular mineral have separated from the mass and rearranged
themselves in concretionary layers, yet so gradually as not
to disturb the lines of original stratification.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 192px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_70" id="Fig_70"></a>Fig. 70.</p>
<img src="images/fig070.png" width="192" height="77" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are other instances, similar to the last in all respects,
except that the segregated portion does not take the concretionary
form. When gypsum is distributed in small proportion through
a formation, there seems very little reason to doubt but that it is,
by a molecular action, segregated from the strata in lenticular
masses, as at a (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>). Many
of the limestone strata contain
irregular aggregations of quartz.
It is presumed that the siliceous
and calcareous matter was deposited
together as sediment, and that the aggregation has resulted from
a movement among the particles similar to that by which the concretionary
structure is produced.</p>

<p>The columnar structure of basalt seems to have resulted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a peculiar molecular action, at first resembling a concretionary
arrangement, while the mass was cooling from a state of fusion. In
experimenting to ascertain the cause of this structure, Mr. Watt
fused in a furnace seven hundred pounds of basalt. When cooled,
he found that &ldquo;numerous spheroids had been
formed, and that when two of them came
in contact, they did not penetrate each other,
but were mutually compressed and separated
by a well-defined plane, invested with a
rusty coating. When several met, they
formed prisms.&rdquo; (<a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71.</a></p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 129px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_71" id="Fig_71"></a>Fig. 71.</p>
<img src="images/fig071.png" width="129" height="113" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>3. <i>Mineral Veins.</i>&mdash;The phenomena of veins are such that
they cannot all be referred to the same cause. In some, the vein-stuff
has been protruded as a dike, differing from ordinary dikes
only in the accidental circumstance that it contains a metal or
a metallic ore.</p>

<p>Mineral veins are not, however, generally filled by injection from
below. It is found that those veins only are productive which have
an east and west direction. But injected dikes run in all directions.
The ore often varies in richness at different depths in the vein,
or passes into ore of some other metal. The ore also varies in
kind and quality, according to the character of the rock through
which the vein passes. These phenomena are best explained by
supposing that the sediment of which the strata were formed contained
the mineral substances of these veins in small proportion.
After they were solidified, and fractures had been formed, the mineral
substance was transferred by molecular action to the fissures,
and deposited.</p>

<p>It was shown by the early experiments of Davy, that voltaic
currents are capable of taking up mineral substances from their
solutions, and removing them from one cup to another. It has
been ascertained that in most mineral veins a proper apparatus
will detect the existence of electric currents. It may be regarded
as certain, that the unequal heating of different parts of the surface
at the same time, by the sun, causes a vast current of feeble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
intensity to circulate around the earth once in twenty-four hours.
The unequal distribution of heat below the surface may also produce
currents subject to other laws. We should expect that these
currents would take up the mineral substances diffused through
rocks, and deposit them by themselves. It seems probable, therefore,
that the molecular action, from which the segregation of
metallic veins has resulted, was that of voltaic currents.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="III_ORGANIC_CAUSES" id="III_ORGANIC_CAUSES"></a>
SECTION III.&mdash;ORGANIC CAUSES.</p>

<p>The effects of all organic causes in producing geological changes
are inconsiderable, compared with those of inorganic causes. With
the exception of the coral formation, the most important of these
effects are those produced by human agency. We find examples
of this agency in the distribution of animals and plants beyond the
regions where they are indigenous; in the increased numbers of
certain species, and in the diminution, if not extinction, of others;
in the modifications of climate, dependent on the destruction of
the forests and the cultivation of the soil; in controlling the course
of rivers; in arresting by embankments the encroachments of the
sea; in breaking up and changing the place of great quantities of
rock by mining and engineering operations; and in the increased
quantity of sediment furnished to streams by cultivating the surface,
and thus preventing the protecting influence which the matted
roots of trees and the smaller vegetables would otherwise have.
Such effects, though attributable mainly to man, are produced in
some degree by all other animals.</p>

<p>Besides these general effects, it is the existence of organic forms
that has conferred on all the sedimentary rocks their fossiliferous
character. <i>The records</i> of the climate of each geological period,
of the physical geography, of the vegetable productions, and of
the animal forms by which the earth was peopled, consist in the
remains of the living beings of these several periods, imbedded in
the contemporaneous rock formations. But in the sediment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
deposited since the human era there must have been furnished
both the remains of human beings and works of art, such as
implements of labor and war, pottery, coins, fragments of ships, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Moreover, the <i>quantity of material</i> which has been furnished by
organic causes is by no means small. The coal-beds are the product
of vegetable growth exclusively. We not unfrequently find
strata of great extent consisting almost entirely of the shells of
molluscous animals, of the stems of encrinites, or of the shields
of microscopic animalcules.</p>

<p>But the most abundant rock which can be regarded as the product
of animal organization is the <i>coral formation</i>. It consists of
immense walls of coral limestone, separating either an atoll or the
land of an island or continent from the open sea. The base of
this wall has a width varying from a hundred feet to a mile or
more, and the outer edge of it is at such a distance from the shore
as to give a depth not much exceeding a hundred feet. Over
this area of the bed of the sea, which forms the base of the wall,
the coral polyp commenced its work. Attaching itself in immense
numbers over this area, it deposits calcareous matter from
its under surface, and thus, by degrees, elevates itself towards the
surface of the water, till it reaches a level a little above low-water
mark. The height of the wall would not, with these conditions,
exceed one hundred feet; but some hundreds of the islands surrounded
by coral walls are gradually subsiding. The depositions
of the polyps keep pace with the subsidence, so that this wall has
reached an elevation from its base of a thousand feet, and in one
instance of two thousand feet. (See Figs. <a href="#Fig_61">61</a>, <a href="#Fig_62">62</a>, <a href="#Fig_63">63</a>, <a href="#Fig_64">64</a>.)</p>

<p>Most of the islands of the torrid zone are thus surrounded with
coral reefs, except a few where the cold polar currents reduce the
temperature too low to admit of their growth. In one instance,
along the north-east coast of New Holland, there is a coral reef,
some twenty-five miles from the land, which has a continuous extension,
excepting occasional inlets of no great depth, of a thousand
miles. The reef along the island of New Caledonia is four hundred
miles long. A large number of other reefs have a nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
equal extension. There is thus an area of several thousands
of square miles covered to a great depth with this coralline limestone.
Some limestone formations of great extent among the older
rocks were the work of similar animals. These lower forms of
organization have, therefore, always been important geological
agents, both in collecting the carbonate of lime from its solution
in the waters of the ocean, and in depositing it as solid rock.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="IV_AQUEOUS_CAUSES" id="IV_AQUEOUS_CAUSES"></a>
SECTION IV.&mdash;AQUEOUS CAUSES.</p>

<p>Water is, next to heat, the most important geological agent.
All the stratified rocks are aqueous deposits, and their total
amount is in some respects a measure of the influence which this
agent has exerted. The materials have been obtained from the
destruction of pre√´xisting rocks, transported by water, and deposited
in layers.</p>

<p>When the first strata were formed, the sediment must have
been obtained entirely from igneous rocks, because only those
rocks existed; but now it is obtained from every kind of rock
which is exposed to abrading or decomposing agencies. Hence,
many of the later formations contain fragments, and sometimes
within the fragments well-characterized fossils, of earlier formations.</p>

<p>The sediment which is ultimately to become stratified rock is
deposited on the beds of the ocean, and other great reservoirs of
water. The formation of most of the aqueous rocks, therefore, as
well as of the igneous rocks, is deep below the surface; and neither
of these operations, on the large scale, is directly exposed to our
observation. We may, however, learn by observation, how the
sediment is furnished to the waters and transported by them, and
we can form some correct ideas of the manner in which it will be
laid down on the bed of the ocean, and solidified.</p>

<p><a name="I_Furnishing_of_Sediment" id="I_Furnishing_of_Sediment"></a>
I. <i>The Furnishing of Sediment.</i></p>

<p>1. Almost all the minerals which occur in the geological formations
are, to some slight extent, <i>soluble in water</i>. Hence, rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
water, by passing through a stratum of earth or rock and re√§ppearing
as a spring, loses the insipidity which it had as pure
water, and becomes palatable. It is then found to hold in
solution some small proportion of earthy substances, upon which
this change of taste depends. Although the proportion of dissolved
matter is very small, yet the surface of earth upon which this distilled
water is shed is one-fourth of the surface of the globe, and
solution below all that surface is constantly taking place. No
inconsiderable amount must thus have been furnished, from the
existing rocks of each period, towards the formation of the strata
of a later period.</p>

<p>There are some substances which are soluble in water, in large
quantities. <i>Rock-salt</i> is an example. It is not found in any
very large proportion in rocks generally, but a very large aggregate
amount has been taken up by the waters which have filtered
through the strata. The ocean gathers into itself, by degrees, all
the soluble substances which are thus taken up. It receives supplies
of water charged with these substances from springs, rivers
and lakes. It returns as much water as it receives; but it is
always in the form of vapor, and is therefore pure water. Hence
the saline properties of the ocean, and of those inland seas which
have no outlets. There is thus gathered the materials for the
rock-salt deposits.</p>

<p>But many substances which are not considered soluble in water
become so by some modification of the water. Water of a high
temperature is capable of dissolving silex. In Iceland and other
volcanic regions, the hot springs are charged with silex, which is
deposited as the water cools. Thus, siliceous formations accumulate
around springs of this kind. The various agates may have been
deposited from such solutions.</p>

<p>In the decomposition of mica, felspar and volcanic rocks, a considerable
amount of potassa is set free. Potassa or soda renders
the water in which it is dissolved capable of dissolving silex in
large quantity. In these ways water removes, with some degree
of rapidity, one of the most insoluble minerals which rocks contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In volcanic countries, and in coal districts, carbonic acid is
abundant, both in spring-water and in the gaseous form. Water
charged with this gas becomes capable of dissolving limestone.
Where the water is exposed to the air, the gas gradually escapes,
and the calcareous matter is deposited. Many accumulations of
this kind are now taking place. Some have already extended
several miles in length, and they are often of great thickness,
in one instance, in Italy, two hundred feet (<a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>). It is also
probable that many calcareous springs issue below the surface of
lakes and seas, and thus, both fresh-water and marine deposits
would now be forming. These formations are distinctly stratified,
and are white and crystalline, and become solid at the time of
deposition.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 383px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_72" id="Fig_72"></a>Fig. 72.</p>
<img src="images/fig072.png" width="383" height="219" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These dissolved materials are less observed than others, because
they do not render the water turbid; but there is reason to believe
that several of the aqueous formations, particularly the limestones,
have been built up chiefly from them.</p>

<p>2. The <i>abrading action of rivers</i> furnishes considerable detrital
matter. The general form of the river courses is determined by
other causes than the agency of the river itself, yet a river which
has a rapid current is continually deepening its channel. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
proof of this by observing, when the water is low, that irregularity
of surface which running water always produces, by wearing away
the softer parts of the rock, and leaving the harder in relief.
Hence, a river will have its rapids either where the hardest strata
occur, and which therefore wear down least rapidly, or where the
rock has been hardened by the intrusion or near proximity of
dikes.</p>

<p>The abrading power of rivers occasionally becomes greatly
increased by waterfalls. The force which the water acquires in
its descent is such as to excavate a deep cavity at the foot of the
fall, reaching back under the ledge from which the water descends.
The ledge is therefore constantly being undermined. The cataract
of Niagara is peculiar, in having the rock at its base of a soft and
friable texture, so that it is rapidly worn away, while the upper
rock is a compact siliceous limestone. If the order of superposition
had been the reverse, the falls would have been converted
into a series of rapids. It is now preserved as a single fall, and
as such it has probably cut the gorge, about two hundred feet
deep and seven miles in length, through which its waters now
reach Lake Ontario. A few years since, a large mass, perhaps
half an acre in area, fell from the centre of the horse-shoe fall.
Another mass of equal size has recently fallen from the western
extremity of the ledge. Thus the fall is gradually receding.</p>

<p>But the foreign substances, such as drift-wood, ice, sand and
gravel, with which the waters of a river are occasionally charged,
contribute more than everything else to its abrading power. At
such times its volume is generally greatest, and its current the
most rapid. Its bed is then sometimes perceptibly deepened and
widened in a few hours.</p>

<p>Much the greater part, however, of the earthy matter which
rivers convey in such quantity to the ocean, is furnished by other
means than the eroding action of the river itself. It is the loose
material, the soil and alluvium, to which the solid rocks have been
reduced by the imperceptible but incessantly operating atmospheric
agencies, from which most of the sediment of rivers is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
obtained. After a rain, every tributary rivulet is turbid with
suspended earthy matter, and it is from these sources that the
larger streams receive the most of their sediment.</p>

<p>Some observations have been made for the purpose of ascertaining
the quantity of sediment which rivers annually carry into
the sea. The Kennebec furnishes materials which, if spread
evenly on an area of one mile square, and consolidated into rock
of the specific gravity of granite, would have a thickness of six
inches. The Merrimac furnishes about two-thirds as much, the
Ganges about two hundred and fifty times as much, and the Mississippi
two thousand times as much.</p>

<p>Thus, the tendency is, to reduce the highest parts of the land,
and to fill up the depressions of the sea; and though we have not
data enough to form any reliable estimate of the total annual discharge
of sediment into the ocean by rivers, yet they are sufficient
to show that the effects of this kind are on a large scale, and
to relieve us from any impression that existing agencies are inadequate
to the production of the stratified rocks.</p>

<p>3. <i>The action of waves</i> is another means by which detrital
matter is furnished. Wherever the shore consists of loose materials,
and is favorably situated to be acted upon by the waves, there
is annually a sensible encroachment of the sea. Such encroachments
are rapidly making in many places; and thus a large
amount of sediment is delivered to the waters of the ocean.</p>

<p>The waves also encroach upon the coast when it consists of
rocks, even of the most indestructible kinds. They continually
beat upon it, undermine the cliffs, and precipitate them into the
sea. The tides increase the power of the waves, by varying the
place of their action, so as to present the same surface of rock
alternately to the action of water and of the air, frost and sun.
During storms, the waves have sufficient force to break off fragments
of rock from the escarpment, sometimes in masses weighing
twenty tons or more, and remove them many rods inland.</p>

<p>A bold, rocky coast always exhibits evidence of a great amount
of erosion. The steep escarpments and the high rugged shafts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rock (<a href="#Fig_73">Fig. 73</a>) against which the waves now beat are the remnants
of masses of rock which once extended further into the sea,
but have been worn away by the waves. It is by such agency
that the deep inlets and harbors of the coast of New England and
Nova Scotia have been excavated.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 400px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_73" id="Fig_73"></a>Fig. 73.</p>
<img src="images/fig073.png" width="400" height="254" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This more violent action of the waves is only occasional; but
when of less power, they are incessantly rolling the loosened fragments
of rock upon each other, and thus wearing them down to
particles small enough to be carried away by the water.</p>

<p>4. The action of waves is confined to the coast, and never
extends to great depths. But <i>marine currents</i> act principally on
the bed of the sea. The temperature of the mass of the ocean
is much higher in the equatorial than in the polar regions.
At the surface, the difference amounts to sixty degrees. The
waters of the torrid zone are thus expanded, and flow over the
colder waters of the north and south; while these colder waters
of the polar seas flow back, in an under current, towards the
equator.</p>

<p>For the same reason,&mdash;a difference of temperature,&mdash;there will
be, in the higher regions of the atmosphere, a current of warm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
moist air flowing from the equator north and south, while the cold
and dry air conies in from the polar regions towards the equator.
In this way the equatorial waters are carried, in a state of vapor,
towards the poles, where they are condensed, and go to increase
the currents of water moving towards the equator.</p>

<p>Such are the general causes of the oceanic movements in a
north and south direction; but these currents at once become
deflected westward, by the diurnal revolution of the earth, as the
trade winds do. Hence there results a Pacific equatorial current,
which has a motion of about thirty miles a day, and an Atlantic
equatorial current, moving from sixty to seventy miles a day. The
principal marine currents are shown in <a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>.</p>

<p>The currents moving towards the poles are superficial, and
therefore do not produce any marked geological effects. But the
polar currents, and those which are produced from them, are of
great depth, and there is no reason to suppose that they do not
move, from their commencement, along the bed of the ocean.
There is also reason to suppose that they exist at great depths,
where the opposing superficial currents entirely conceal them.</p>

<p>Wherever these currents come to the surface, their motion is
undoubtedly greater than it is at the bottom, where it is retarded
by the friction which the moving waters encounter, and by the
irregularities of the bed of the ocean. It should, however, be
remembered, that they move with the weight of the whole superior
body of water; and therefore, though the motion be very slow, it
will still possess great power.</p>

<p>Any irregularities in the bed of the ocean beneath such a
current must be subject to very rapid abrasion. We shall sea
hereafter, that earthquake vibrations often shiver the rocks at the
solid surface; and if any of these ridges at the bottom of the
ocean were thus acted upon, the loosened portions would be swept
away by the current and deposited at lower levels, or where the
current subsides. If, in any instance during an earthquake convulsion,
a fault should be produced across one of these marine currents,
like the great fault of over five hundred feet in England,
the abutment thus thrown up would soon be worn down; and if it
consisted of unconsolidated matter, it would be swept away almost
bodily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 679px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_74" id="Fig_74"></a>Fig. 74.</p>
<img src="images/fig074.png" width="679" height="414" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of such currents will be greatest where they are
deflected by a continent or island. Thus, a marine current sets
from near New Holland in a direct line to the north of the island
of Madagascar, where it is arrested by the African coast, and
deflected into the narrow Mozambique channel, and there acquires
a velocity of four or five miles an hour. It is impossible that any
kind of rock should receive the constant force of such a body of
water without being rapidly worn away; and, if there should be
any difference of texture in this rocky barrier, the softer portions
would yield the most rapidly, and thus valleys might be formed.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the deep indentation on the western
coast of Africa may have been due, in a great measure, to the coast
current from the Cape of Good Hope; and that the Caribbean Sea
and the Gulf of Mexico may have been excavated by the force of
the Atlantic equatorial current being thrown into this angle.</p>

<p>We may regard these currents as oceanic rivers; and it is obvious
that the volume of the terrestrial rivers would bear no comparison
with that of these currents, and their effects would be
equally small in the comparison. The Gulf Stream, and the
Mozambique and other similar currents, must be wearing down the
valleys through which they flow, to such an extent as to furnish
an immense amount of detrital matter for the formation of new
rocks.</p>

<p>It is principally to the agency of these deep marine currents
that we are to refer those extensive denudations, so abundant on
the present continents, such as the wearing out of the intermediate
masses of rock between the hills already referred to
(<a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>), the denudation of the Connecticut river sandstone, and,
perhaps, the excavations which have formed Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario.</p>

<p><a name="II_Transportation_of_Sediment" id="II_Transportation_of_Sediment"></a>
II. <i>The Transportation of Sediment.</i></p>

<p>The detrital matter obtained in these several ways is swept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
away by running water. The specific gravity of rocks does not,
in general, exceed two and a half. Hence, to keep them suspended
in water, will require a force of only three-fifths of what would be
necessary to suspend them in the atmosphere. In the case of river
currents, the velocity and irregularity of motion are generally
sufficient to keep all the finer sediment equally distributed.</p>

<p>There will, however, be a division of the sediment according to
the strength of the current. Hence, the bed of a mountain
stream, if there is any loose material, always consists of pebbles.
As it approaches the alluvial region, the bed is sandy; and when
the current becomes very sluggish, it consists of a fine mud.</p>

<p>Rivers never deposit all their sediment, some of them none of it,
along their course. Large rivers continue partially distinct from
the ocean water to a considerable distance beyond their mouths.
The waters of the Amazon have been recognized at a distance of
three hundred miles. This depends in part upon the volume and
velocity of the river; more, however, upon the fact that river water
is lighter than sea water. This extension of a river will, in most
cases, be sufficient to deliver a part of its sediment into a marine
current. When such a current sweeps very near the mouth of a
river, as it does to that of the Niger, the Amazon, or the Mississippi,
it is probable that most of its sediment is carried away by it.</p>

<p>The transporting power of a marine current is greater than
that of a river, in consequence of the greater specific gravity of its
water; but it has scarcely any of that irregular motion of rapid
rivers, upon which their transporting power in a great degree
depends. The force of the current alone, when it reaches the
bottom, is, however, sufficient to remove every form of loose earthy
matter. Thus it may be presumed that the Gulf Stream sweeps
all the sediment from its bed until it reaches the latitude of Cape
Hatteras, where the cold waters from the north begin to underlie
it, and it takes the character of a surface stream.</p>

<p>But the transporting power of marine currents depends mostly
upon the depth of water. It is found, by experiment, that ordinary
river sediment will sink in water about one foot in an hour. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
current, therefore, of a thousand feet in depth, which moves a mile
in an hour, would carry its sediment a thousand miles. It is obvious,
then, that there is no part of the bed of the sea which may not
be receiving sediment.</p>

<p><a name="III_The_Deposition_of_Sediment" id="III_The_Deposition_of_Sediment"></a>
III. <i>The Deposition of Sediment.</i></p>

<p>From what has been said of the weight of sediment, it follows
that it will be deposited whenever the water in which it is
suspended is at rest. Hence, when a river increases in breadth so
as to form a lake, the waters at the outlet are seldom turbid. The
earthy matters with which the principal and tributary streams
were charged all settle to the bottom, and go to lessen the capacity
of the reservoir. Thus lakes are continually diminishing in depth
and area. In many instances, they are already filled with sediment,
and are thus converted into alluvial plains, through which the
river flows in a narrow channel.</p>

<p>It is frequently the case that a river, as it approaches the sea,
has so slow a motion that its sediment is deposited on the bed of
the stream. Thus the bed will be raised, and the banks will also
be raised, by the deposition of sediment upon them at periods of
overflow. The river will then be raised above the adjacent country.
The river Po, for the last part of its course, is from ten to
twenty feet above the adjacent lands. The same is true of the
Mississippi, and many other rivers. The streets of New Orleans
are several feet below the surface of the river. In an uninhabited
country, such a river would soon seek a new and lower channel; but
in a populous country, it becomes a matter of interest and safety to
confine the river in its old channel, by artificial embankments.</p>

<p>But the principal part of the sediment of rivers is conveyed to
the sea. It here mingles with the debris which the waves have
furnished, and a part of it is deposited to form deltas. The
remaining part is taken up by marine currents, mingled with the
debris which they have furnished, and is spread out on the bed of
the ocean.</p>

<p>Of the extent of these deposits we can form no estimate. Those
of rivers and lakes are comparatively unimportant, as they are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the older formations. Some of the delta deposits are already of
great extent. That of the Ganges contains an area of twenty-six
thousand square miles, that of the Niger twenty-five thousand, and
that of the Nile twelve thousand. The delta of the Rhone has
increased its area by three hundred square miles in the last thousand
years. The Po has encroached upon the Adriatic two thousand
square miles in the last two thousand years, and the Mississippi
has enlarged its delta by one hundred square miles in the last
hundred years. In the deep valleys of the ocean accumulations
may be taking place on as large a scale as they ever have been in
former times.</p>

<p><a name="IV_Character_of_the_Formations" id="IV_Character_of_the_Formations"></a>
IV. <i>Character of the Formations thus produced.</i></p>

<p>Sedimentary matter thus deposited would take the form of
<i>strata</i>. Thus, a delta deposit may receive at one time from a
river a layer of coarse gravel and pebbles, and in the course of a
few hours the current may be so reduced that it will convey to
the same place only fine sand and silt. Or, if a depositing current
receive its sediment only at intervals, the heaviest particles would
be thrown down first, and the more finely levigated particles would
continue to fall, till the water became transparent. Another supply
would furnish another similar stratum, and so on. The same
arrangement might result from the sediment being furnished by
different rivers. Thus, if sediment were furnished to the Gulf
Stream by the Merrimac river, and the streams emptying into the
Bay of Fundy, the freshets would occur earlier in the season in
the Merrimac, and it would furnish a supply of sediment from a
region of primary rocks. A later supply would come from the red
sandstone region of Nova Scotia, and the stratification would be
indicated by the different kinds of rock produced. Thus stratification
will result from difference in the color, composition, or size of
the particles of which rocks consist. A great variety of causes,
both general and local, may therefore give to a deposit this character.
Hence, as stratified rocks are produced by the sediment now
laid down from water, we may conclude that the older stratified
rocks are the sediment deposited in like manner, in former times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The occurrence of layers of different composition, as one way in
which the stratification is indicated, is produced by local and frequently
recurring causes. There are, however, other alternations
of much greater extent; those, for example, nearly twenty in number,
distinguished by striking differences in lithological character,
into which the New York system of rocks is divided. These
alternations have resulted from more general causes. The physical
geography of a wide region must have been so different, at the
different periods during which these several formations were
deposited, as to change, at each period, the kind of sediment furnished
to the forming currents, and modify the types of animal life.</p>

<p>We have seen that the same causes that determined the stratified
arrangement will determine the alternations of strata of coarse
and fine materials.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the stratification of the marine deposits will be
nearly horizontal. If the surface were very irregular upon which
the deposition commenced, the irregularity would constantly diminish;
for the movement of the water over this surface, however slow,
would tend to remove the accumulations from the highest points,
and leave them at the lowest (<a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>). Delta and lake deposits
will, however, dip somewhat, though
never at a high angle, towards the
deep water. In certain situations,
where a river and a tidal wave, coming
in conflict, cause, in succession, eddies and currents in opposite
directions, we should expect to find the stratification very irregular
(<a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>); sometimes false stratifications (<i>a b</i>), sometimes the strata
cut off abruptly, and at other times contorted or dipping in opposite
directions within short distances.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 181px;">

</div>

<p>Wherever sediment is deposited, it will entomb whatever of the
remains of animal or vegetable life may be mingled with it. They
will be at once protected against the influence of all the ordinary
decomposing agencies, and will continue for ages to retain their
peculiar markings, and even their colors. They will thus constitute,
in all future time, a record of the present condition of the organic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
world. The lacustrine deposits can contain only fresh-water species
of animals, marine deposits only marine animals, while deltas may
contain the remains of marine life mingled with those which have
been washed down by rivers. The remains of birds, insects, and
terrestrial animals, may occasionally occur, in every kind of deposit.
Sediment deposited in deep water will never contain fossils in
abundance, the deep parts of the ocean being almost wholly destitute
of animal or vegetable life. It is only in water of a few
fathoms that the greater number of species and of individuals
occur. In all these particulars the deposits now forming sustain a
close resemblance to the older formations.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 306px;">

</div>

<p>There are certain formations, as that of the coal, which required
conditions for their formation different from those of ordinary
sedimentary deposits. Coal consists of mineralized vegetable matter.
Its vegetable origin is proved by the uniform occurrence of
vegetable fossils almost exclusively in the coal measures. When
reduced to thin slices and examined under a high magnifying
power, a structure very similar to the ligneous tissue of existing
conifer√¶ is sometimes found to exist. There are probably vegetable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
deposits now taking place not altogether unlike those which
produced the coal measures.</p>

<p>We know that many rivers&mdash;the Mississippi, for example&mdash;now
carry into the sea great quantities of ligneous matter. Before the
country was inhabited by man, the quantity was undoubtedly much
greater than it now is. It floats for a time; but the ligneous tissue
itself is heavier than water, and as soon as the air is excluded from
the pores, and they are filled with water, it will sink. The woody
and earthy matters are swept into the sea together; but, as they
sink under different circumstances, they will be deposited separately.
<i>Thus wood may continue to accumulate in particular places in
the sea</i> for long periods, with but little intermixture of earthy
substances.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be expected that, in the progress of geological
changes, the places which at one time receive deposits of wood will
at another receive detrital matter, and thus <i>the wood will become
deeply buried</i> beneath sedimentary strata.</p>

<p>Wood thus situated will become converted into coal. Trees
which had been covered to considerable depth with earth have
been found near the Mississippi river changed to lignite, a substance
resembling charcoal. In this case, the wood had been
exposed to no greater heat than is common to the crust of the
earth at the depth where it was found; and yet it had undergone
this change since the country has been known to Europeans,
as it retained the marks of the axe when it was discovered. It
has also been found by experiment that vegetable matter, by long
submersion in water, passes into the state of lignite. This is the
first step in the conversion of wood into mineral coal.</p>

<p>When lignite is exposed to moderate heat and great pressure, it
loses the characters of lignite, and becomes mineral coal. This
is shown by facts observed in Germany, Ireland and Iceland, where
beds of lignite have been overspread by basalt. The upper portions
of the lignite are changed to mineral coal. The lower portions,
which the heat did not reach, retain the characters of
lignite.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Beds of vegetable matter, with a great thickness of rock deposited
above them, would therefore be subject to all the conditions
necessary to convert them into coal, namely, pressure from the
superincumbent mass, and the heat which the strata uniformly
assume at great depths.</p>

<p>It is not improbable, therefore, that coal-beds are now forming,
and that they have been formed at every geological period since
an abundant terrestrial vegetation commenced. Accordingly, there
occurs in Virginia an extensive coal-field in the o√∂lite formation.
Coal-fields also occur in England, of less extent, in the same formation.
In France, and other parts of Europe, there are extensive
beds of lignite in the tertiary formation.</p>

<p>We have therefore no difficulty in accounting, in a general way,
for the formations of the carboniferous period. The vegetables
were probably less woody than those of the present time of equal
size, and were therefore more easily prostrated and committed to
the waters. They grew rapidly in moist ground, and perhaps in
shoal-water, and required an atmosphere charged with moisture
and of a high temperature. Thus much is inferred from the conditions
most favorable for the growth of recent species analogous to
the coal-plants. These recent species are tropical plants, and grow
in moist insular situations, conditions which would have existed
at the carboniferous period, if the present coal-fields were then an
archipelago dotted with low islands.</p>

<p>Such being regarded as the origin of the coal-beds, the <i>alternations</i>
of the earthy and carbonaceous strata may be referred, provisionally,
to those great changes in physical geography upon which
the other alternations of strata on a large scale depend. But the
regularity with which the coal-seams and sandstone succeed each
other presents some difficulties which, in the present state of knowledge,
we cannot satisfactorily account for.</p>

<p><i>Beds of salt</i> occur, interstratified with other rocks, in nearly all
countries. Still, it is not a sedimentary deposit, and its formation
must depend upon peculiar circumstances. In New York, saline,
together with earthy matter, constitutes the Onondaga limestone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
one of the formations of the New York system. In Kentucky, the
strata of rock-salt are in the coal formation; in England, they are
in the new red sandstone; in Spain, they are in the greensand, and
in Poland they are in tertiary strata. The conditions of its formation
have therefore existed in connection with the deposition of
every fossiliferous rock.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the ocean is the principal reservoir of
the saline matters which are taken up whenever water percolates
through rocks. It must happen not unfrequently, in the course of
submarine elevations, that a basin of sea-water will be cut off from
its communication with the sea; and from this basin the evaporation
might be more rapid than the supply of water. The great
salt-lake of Utah is undoubtedly a basin of this kind. The Mediterranean
Sea is another such basin, not yet wholly separated from
the ocean. The evaporation exceeds the supply of water from the
rivers, and a powerful stream is therefore continually thrown in
from the ocean, through the Strait of Gibraltar. The waters of the
Mediterranean are already more highly charged with salt than
ordinary sea-water. This sea may ultimately become a saturated
solution, and begin to deposit salt. But whether it does, or not, it
indicates the way in which salt-beds may be formed.</p>

<p><a name="V_Solidification_of_Aqueous_Deposits" id="V_Solidification_of_Aqueous_Deposits"></a>
V. <i>Solidification of Aqueous Deposits.</i></p>

<p>Sediment is generally deposited as a soft mud, but in nearly all
the older formations it has become solidified. When rocks are
deposited from a chemical solution, they take at once the solid
form. Such is the case with rock-salt and with limestone, when
the material has been held in solution. Solidification takes place
in nearly the same way when water which holds carbonate of lime
or oxide of iron in solution filters through beds of sand or gravel.
The substance held in solution is deposited in the interstices till
they become filled, and the whole is changed to solid rock.</p>

<p>Some rocks are composed of such materials that they <i>set</i>, like
hydraulic cement, when they are deposited. Other rocks become
solid simply by drying. Thus a deposit now forming in Lake
Superior becomes, by drying, nearly as hard as granite. Such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
deposit will therefore become solid whenever it shall be elevated
above the water.</p>

<p>The pressure to which all but the upper layers are subjected is
probably sufficient to reduce most rocks to the solid state. Dry
and pulverized clay is reduced by artificial pressure, for a moment,
almost to stone. The pressure upon the deep-seated rocks is constant,
and greater than any artificial pressure can be.</p>

<p>In addition to these causes, all the older rocks have been subjected
to a high temperature, some of them nearly to that of
fusion. By this means the solidification of every kind of rock
would be promoted, and probably some may have been reduced by
it to the solid state, which would otherwise have remained as an
incoherent mass.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="V_AQUEO-GLACIAL_ACTION" id="V_AQUEO-GLACIAL_ACTION"></a>
SECTION V.&mdash;AQUEO-GLACIAL ACTION.</p>

<p>1. <i>Glaciers.</i>&mdash;A glacier is a mass of ice occupying the bed
of a mountain valley, having a slow progressive motion, and
reaching somewhat lower in the valley than the line of constant
snow. (<a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77.</a> The Glacier des Bois, which may be regarded
as a specimen of the Alpine glaciers, covers an area of about seventeen
square miles. In its lowest portion, when all its branches
have become united into one stream, it has an average width of
half a mile, and is five miles long. It is estimated that the glaciers
of the Alps cover an area of fourteen hundred square miles.
These have been the most carefully studied, though glaciers are
found in the valleys of various other ranges of mountains.</p>

<p>In the higher valleys, the snow, which falls at all seasons of the
year, accumulates in immense quantities, and the steep mountain
sides contribute, by frequent avalanches, to this accumulation. The
snow, when thus increased, does not become a compact, adhesive
mass; but, changing into particles of solid ice, it resembles sand
rather than snow. It is this <i>n√©v√©</i> which constitutes the upper part
of every <i>glacier</i>, and which, in a modified form, constitutes the
lower part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The valleys descend rapidly towards the base of the mountains;
and this snow-ice, having no cohesion between its particles, <i>moves
slowly down the slope of the valley</i>, like a very imperfect liquid.
After descending below the line of perpetual snow, the surface
will melt during the day; and the water, sinking into the porous
mass, becomes frozen, and converts the whole into more or less
compact ice, yet never into a rigid mass. Influenced by its own
weight, and by the pressure of the snow-ice behind, it still continues
its motion, and conforms itself to the shape and curves of the
valley through which it passes. The average movement per annum
may be stated at about five hundred feet.</p>

<p>The temperature of the rocky bed of the valley will be a little,
and but a little, higher than thirty-two degrees. There will therefore
be but little melting at the bed of this river of ice. As it
receives continual accessions from the atmosphere, it will therefore
increase in volume till it descends to the level of perpetual
snow. Below this line <i>the waste exceeds the addition</i>; and as it
approaches the lower and cultivated portions of the valley, it rapidly
diminishes, till it finally loses the solid form, and becomes a
rivulet. The terminus of the glacier is determined principally by
the general climate of the country. Any considerable variation
of climate will cause it to recede, or descend lower down the valley.
The terminus varies, however, somewhat with the seasons,
being lower in winter than in summer, though the motion is much
less in the cold season than in the warm; and it descends many
rods further some seasons than it does others.</p>

<p>The glacier consists principally of snow, more or less modified in
structure; but it also contains whatever else may have been thrown
upon its surface, or into the snows by which it is fed. Tributary
glaciers extend up through all the gorges into which the irregular
surface of the mountain-top is divided. On these rough peaks
there are always fragments of rock, varying in size from fine sand
to masses weighing many tons; some of them loosened when the
mountain was upheaved, some by subsequent earthquake vibrations,
and others still by tempests, lightnings, and changes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
temperature. When the snow has accumulated to a certain
extent on the steep slopes, it falls in avalanches into the valleys,
carrying with it loosened masses of rock, and often breaking off
large fragments from the rocky escarpments against which it
strikes. These avalanches are almost constantly descending, and
hence a glacier always contains considerable <i>earthy matter distributed
through it</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 371px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_77" id="Fig_77"></a>Fig. 77.</p>
<img src="images/fig077.png" width="371" height="496" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The friction of the glacier, at its edges and along its bed, separates
more or less of the rock over which it moves; and hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
there is always a layer of mud and pebbles under the glacier, and
a line of loose fragments, called a <i>lateral moraine</i>, at the sides.
When two glaciers unite, the two lateral moraines, thus brought
together, come to the surface, forming a medial moraine, and show
the line of junction sometimes for miles.</p>

<p>The friction of the glacier on the bed of rock, assisted by the
layer of pebbles, will wear down the prominent portions, and
everywhere polish the surface. Fragments of rocks may be frozen
into the glacier at all depths. Those which lie near the lower surface
of the glacier would, by slight melting of that surface, project
downward so as to act as a graver&rsquo;s tool on the rock over which it
passes. Hence, when the extremity of the glacier has receded
beyond its ordinary limit, the surface of rock exposed is found,
upon examination, to be <i>polished</i>, <i>striated</i>, and <i>occasionally grooved</i>
an inch or two deep.</p>

<p>Since the waste is almost wholly superficial, earthy matter, which
was at first concealed in the mass of the glacier, is continually coming
to view, as the surface melts and runs off. Thus, none of the
freight of the glacier is left along its course, but all is carried to
its terminus and discharged there. Hence, at the lower extremity
of the glacier there is always an embankment of earth, pebbles,
and boulders. If the glacier recedes a few yards at one season of
the year, and leaves its earthy fragments scattered over this surface,
they will be pushed forward into a ridge, as the glacier again
advances. This ridge is called a <i>terminal moraine</i>, and consists
wholly of substances which have been separated from the mountain
mass, often at the highest beginnings of the glacier. At the terminus
of all the Alpine glaciers, there is a series of these moraines
(<i>a a a</i>, <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a>) marking the successive limits of the glacier in
former times.</p>

<p>There is a ridge of boulders on the north side of the Swiss valley,
near the base of the Jura Mountains, resembling a terminal
moraine. These boulders consist of several groups, distinguished
by peculiarities of structure and composition; and each group lies
opposite to the particular Alpine valley which now furnishes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
same kind of fragments. It has been thought that, at a former
period of more severe climate, the Swiss valley was filled in part
with ice, and that the present glaciers extended across it to the
Jura Mountains.</p>

<p>It is found that the polished and striated surfaces of the rocks
in the Alpine valleys are precisely like the surface of the rock,
which has not been exposed to atmospheric influences, in the
north of Europe and America. It has been proposed to extend
the glacier theory, and account for these phenomena by supposing
that the north polar regions were, at the ice period, capped with
a glacier-mass, extending as far south as the drift phenomena
appear.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted that the phenomena of polished surfaces
and transported materials in the immediate vicinity of the Alps,
and near other high mountains, are correctly referred to glacial
action. This theory has therefore solved, in part, one of the most
difficult problems in geology; but there is great difficulty in
extending it so as to account for the drift phenomena in general.
If the motion depends upon gravitation only, the origin must have
a much greater elevation than the terminus, which would not be
the case in the great glacier supposed to extend southward from
the Arctic regions. Elevation of temperature, it has been thought,
might account for the movement of the mass southward.</p>

<p>2. <i>Icebergs.</i>&mdash;In very high latitudes, the ice, which makes out
from the land into the sea during the cold season, suffers but little
waste at any time. This sheet of ice continues to increase in
breadth and thickness, by congelation, from year to year. The
spray and the snows of each succeeding year will also add to the
mass. It thus accumulates to the height of several hundred
yards. It will also reach down a good many feet below the surface
of the sea, and will extend back on the land, or lie heaped up
against a precipitous escarpment, and firmly frozen to it.</p>

<p>After a certain amount of extension over the sea, the accumulated
weight of the ice and snow would tend to depress it, and
break it loose from the shore. The waves would tend to the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
result, and would act at greater mechanical advantage, as its extension
from the shore becomes greater. <i>Hence, it would ultimately
become separated from the shore</i>, and float in the water.</p>

<p>At its commencement, the earth, pebbles and rocks, which may
lie along the shore, and as far down into the sea as the congelation
extends, are frozen into it. In many situations its mass would
be increased by avalanches while it remained attached to the land,
and these would supply also masses of earth and rocks, as they do to
glaciers. When it becomes loosened from the shore, it will break
off, and carry with it some of the earthy portions of the coast, or
the less firmly fixed masses of rock from the escarpment against
which it formed. Thus every iceberg becomes <i>freighted</i>, more
or less, <i>with earth and rocks</i>. This has almost uniformly been
found to be the case, when they have been landed upon by ships&rsquo;
crews and examined.</p>

<p>We have seen that the general tendency of the waters of the
ocean, and of the lower stratum of the atmosphere, is to a motion
from the poles towards the equator. However irregular, therefore,
the course of an iceberg may be, its general <i>movement</i>, influenced
both by the prevailing winds and by ocean currents, will be
<i>towards the equator</i>.</p>

<p>These floating ice-mountains (<a href="#Fig_78">Fig. 78</a>) are formed in <i>great numbers,
and of vast size</i>. The relative specific gravity of ice and
water are such that nine cubic feet of ice, below the surface of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
water, will support one cubic foot above it. As icebergs are often
one or two hundred feet high, their vertical depth must be a thousand
feet at least; and their area is equal to a square mile, and
sometimes it is much greater. In 1840, the United States Exploring
Expedition, in the extreme southern ocean, coasted for eighty
miles along a single iceberg. They are never absent from the
polar seas; and at certain seasons they are so abundant along the
usual course of vessels from New York to Liverpool, as greatly
to obstruct and endanger navigation.</p>

<p>An iceberg may continue for some time to increase in size, while
floating in the polar seas, but will at length reach a latitude where
the waste will exceed the additions, in consequence of the temperature
both of the air and of the water. It will, therefore, drop
gradually the earthy matters which it contains, upon the bed of
the ocean.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that icebergs may often reach down so far
as to strike the highest points of the bed of the sea. The ice
would be lifted, and glide over the elevation, without suffering any
perceptible deviation from its general course. It would thus affect
the surface of rocks exactly like a glacier. If, however, the iceberg
becomes permanently stranded, and melts in one place, its
earthy matters will be thrown down upon the elevation which first
arrested it.</p>

<p>If the bed of the sea, between the fortieth and sixtieth degrees
of latitude, could be exposed for examination, the rocky surface
would be found to be polished and striated by the icebergs which
have passed over it, and the whole surface would be strewed with
boulders and drifted materials brought from Arctic and Antarctic
lands. Sometimes it would be accumulated in heaps, and sometimes
spread nearly over the surface.</p>

<p>We have seen that very recently, probably about the close of the
tertiary period, the portion of Europe and America over which the
northern drift is found, has been depressed several hundred feet.
It may be presumed that at that time icebergs floated over it, polished
the surface of the rocks, and distributed the boulders and
other drift which is now found upon it.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="VI_IGNEOUS_CAUSES" id="VI_IGNEOUS_CAUSES"></a>
SECTION VI.&mdash;IGNEOUS CAUSES.</p>

<p>I. <i>Of the Temperature of the Mass of the Earth.</i>&mdash;Heat has
been the most efficient agent in determining and modifying the
structure of the earth; and, in order that the explanations of the
phenomena referable to this cause may be intelligible, some idea
must be formed of the actual present condition of the mass of the
earth with respect to heat.</p>

<p>At any point of the surface there are variations of temperature,
depending on external causes. But these variations are found to
extend only a little way below the surface,&mdash;never more than a
hundred feet. At greater depths, it is found that the temperature
invariably increases with the depth. Deep mines have always a
temperature above the mean annual temperature at the surface.
The water obtained by deep boring is always tepid when it comes
to the surface. The thermal springs, so abundant in this country
and in Europe, are so situated as to justify the impression that
their waters come from great depths. To make these general
observations of any value, we must determine the law by which
the temperature increases. The result of all the observations yet
made, in mines and upon wells and springs, is that, below the first
hundred feet, the temperature increases by one degree of Fahrenheit&rsquo;s
scale for every forty-five feet.</p>

<p>Regarding this law of increment as applicable to all depths, at
ten miles below the surface we should have a temperature above
that produced by the combustion of wood; and at twenty-five
miles, a temperature of three thousand degrees, by which nearly
all mineral substances would be reduced to a state of fusion.</p>

<p>The general conclusion of a temperature sufficient to melt the
mineral substances of which rocks are composed, at no considerable
distance below the surface, is confirmed by the fact that portions of
the interior of the earth&mdash;at least, at the volcanic centres&mdash;are in
a melted state. The intimate connection between some volcanoes
situated a hundred miles or more apart, so that they are alternately
in a state of activity and rest, indicates that these centres are connected,&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
subterranean melted lava extends from one to the
other, so that when one is active, the elastic force is relieved at
the other. These deep-seated lakes of lava must therefore underlie
large areas.</p>

<p>We are justified, then, in concluding that the mass of the earth,
with the exception of a comparatively thin superficial layer, has a
very high temperature.</p>

<p>By way of accounting for this temperature, it is now generally
assumed that the earth was originally in a state of fusion; that it
was a mass of liquid lava (if, indeed, it had not a temperature sufficient
to reduce it to the a√´riform state). Starting with this
assumption, there must necessarily be a gradual reduction of temperature
by radiation, and a time must arrive when the surface
would be crusted over with solidified lava; and this crust would
increase in thickness as the cooling advanced, the interior still
retaining its heat and liquidity. The present condition of the crust
of the earth, its form, that of an oblate spheroid, with the exact
difference of the equatorial and polar diameters which is found to
exist, as well as the phenomena of volcanic eruptions, will all
admit of explanation on this hypothesis.</p>

<p>It has, however, been rejected by some; and, to account for the
heat of the interior of the earth, it is suggested that, if the bases
of the earths and alkalies, particularly potassium, sodium and calcium,
exist in their metallic state beneath the surface, the rapid
oxidation of them by the access of water would generate heat of
sufficient intensity to melt the oxidized materials, and thus account
for the phenomena attributable to heat.</p>

<p>Either of these hypotheses may be adopted; but it is not necessary
to account at all for the existence of this temperature. The
fact is susceptible of proof; and, though we may not be able to
frame any hypothesis to account for its existence, we may yet
employ the fact in the explanation of other phenomena.</p>

<p><a name="II_The_Action_of_Internal_Heat" id="II_The_Action_of_Internal_Heat"></a>
II. <i>The Action of Internal Heat in producing Volcanoes.</i></p>

<p>The phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes are evidently produced
by some force operating from below. The effect of heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
alone would be to reduce the rock to a liquid state. There is no
reason to suppose that it is ever sufficient to reduce them to the
a√´riform state. The elastic force must therefore depend upon
some other substance associated with the lava, and this substance
is water.</p>

<p>This will be shown by an examination of lavas. At the time
of their ejection, they are in a fluid or semi-fluid state; but it is not
a complete fusion. Even the most fluid lavas contain particles of
minerals in a solid state. The liquidity depends upon the fusion
of the more fusible portions, and upon the steam of water at a
high temperature, which fills the interstices between the solid particles.
The porous character of cooled lavas is produced by the
steam which filled the cavities previous to solidification. Steam
always escapes from the surface of a lava current while it is cooling,
and it is always discharged in immense volumes from the
orifice of eruption, in connection with the lava, and especially at
the close of an eruption.</p>

<p>The geographical position of volcanoes, also, leads to the conclusion
that water is essential to their activity. There are five
principal lines of volcanic activity. One, commencing at the
southern extremity of South America, extends northward along
the Andes and Cordilleras to California or Oregon. The second
has a north-east and south-west direction, from the Aleutian
Islands through the Kurule, Japanese, and Philippine islands,
till it meets the third line, lying in a nearly east and west direction,
embracing Sumatra, Java, and most of the Pacific volcanic islands.
A fourth band commences in the Grecian islands, and extends
westward so as to include the volcanoes of Italy and the adjacent
islands, and the Azores. The fifth band embraces the volcanic
islands of the West Indies, crosses Mexico in about the latitude
of the city of Mexico, and extends into the Pacific. There are
also some isolated centres of volcanic activity, such as Iceland.
These volcanic bands embrace about three hundred volcanoes. It
will be seen that they must nearly all be in close proximity to the
ocean, or to large seas. About two-thirds of them are on islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Moreover, the volcanic vents which are wholly submarine are
probably very numerous.</p>

<p>This circumstance of the position of volcanoes establishes a presumption
that they cannot exist at a distance from some large
body of water; and, taking it in connection with the constant
presence of aqueous vapor in lava, we are justified in the conclusion
that <i>the presence of water is an essential condition of volcanic
activity</i>.</p>

<p>Knowing that heat and water exist at the volcanic centres, it is
not difficult to form an idea of <i>their mode of operation</i>. The
water, diffused through the interstices of the lava, and subjected to
a temperature sufficient to melt the lava, would possess an <i>elastic
power</i>, which, though never computed, we may well suppose capable
of overcoming any resistance which the crust of the earth
might present. The repressing force will be the tenacity and
weight of the superincumbent strata. Whenever the elasticity is
superior to this repressing force, it will manifest itself in the fracture
of the strata, and often in the ejection or lava to the surface.</p>

<p>This fracturing of the strata, produced by an uplifting subterranean
force, is believed to be the cause of the noise and the vibratory
motion which are the chief phenomena of earthquakes. The
elastic force may raise lava to the surface, and thus the fracture
would become a volcano. But the force may expend itself by the
discharge of vapor into the fissure, or by merely filling it with
lava. In either case, the only evidence of the existence of the
volcanic force would be the noise and the wave-like motion experienced
at the surface. The cause of the volcano and earthquake
is therefore the same, though the phenomena which characterize
them are different.</p>

<p>When the strata are is thus fractured, lava may for a time be
discharged along the whole line. By the cooling of lava in the
fracture, it would become partially reunited. Still, this would
be the line of least resistance. It would therefore be again burst
through in certain places, which would long continue to be orifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of discharge, and thus the original fracture would determine <i>a line
of volcanic activity</i>.</p>

<p>The repressing force may become greater at an orifice of eruption
than at some other point, either by the great accumulation of
ejected materials around the opening, or by the dormancy of the
volcano long enough for the complete solidification of the lava
with which the channel was filled. The least resistance may then
be far from any previous vent, when a new orifice of discharge
will be opened, and <i>a new volcano make its appearance</i>. It
seems probable, also, that volcanoes may become extinct by the
reduction of temperature at the volcanic centre, and that new volcanic
centres may be formed; but the cause of this change of temperature
is not yet well understood. New volcanoes have broken
out in the sea, near Iceland, in several instances; others in the
volcanic line east of Asia. Graham Island, situated between Sicily
and Africa, was formed by an eruption which broke out in the
bed of the sea where the soundings were more than one hundred
fathoms. The island was at one time two hundred feet above the
sea, and three miles in circumference. It was, however, gradually
destroyed by the action of the waves, and now remains a dangerous
reef, covered by less than two fathoms water. The volcano
of Jorullo, in Mexico, was formed in this way. Previous to the
formation of the mountain, the region where it now is was a cultivated
table-land. During the year 1759 volcanic action commenced
and continued, until, at the expiration of twelve months, a
cone had been formed having an elevation of sixteen hundred feet
above the adjacent plain.</p>

<p>An orifice of eruption is at first but little elevated above the
general surface; but, by the accumulation of ejected matter, a cone
is at length formed around the vent. The upper portion of a cone
always consists of these materials, but there may also be in progress
a general elevation of that part of the earth&rsquo;s crust, and the
cone will partake of that general elevation. The cones of the
Andes owe their height, in a great measure, to a general movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of elevation; those of √Ütna and Vesuvius, in a greater degree, to
accumulation of ejected matter.</p>

<p>In either way, the height may become so great that the force
necessary to raise a column of lava to the top would be greater
than the sides of the cone, weakened as they always are by fractures
in all directions, can sustain. Hence, the highest craters of
√Ütna and South America have long been closed, and the lava
escapes through fissures at a lower level, and <i>lateral cones</i> are
produced.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 431px;">

<img src="images/fig079.png" width="431" height="234" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The form which the materials have, when ejected from volcanoes,
depends mainly upon the degree of liquidity of the lavas at
the volcanic foci. If the liquidity is very perfect, the aqueous
vapor will readily rise through the lava. The steam thus separated
will drive before it whatever rocks, or previous lavas, may
obstruct it. In their progress they would be reduced to sand and
powder, and ejected as <i>volcanic cinders</i>. (<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79.</a> If the lava
possess considerable viscidity, the aqueous vapor will separate with
more difficulty, and the lava and vapor will ascend the channel
together. Large bubbles of vapor will, however, collect with
more or less of frequency; and, as they rise through the lava,
will drive forward a portion of it, and cause the overflow to take
place by pulsations. As the bubbles reach the surface, their bursting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
causes the loud reports, which are compared to the discharge
of heavy artillery. With each explosion some of the lava will be
projected violently into the air, and, cooling, will fall to the surface
as scori√¶,&mdash;or, if the lava be highly vitreous, it will be
drawn out into fibres, and descend as volcanic glass.</p>


<p><a name="III_Geological_Phenomena" id="III_Geological_Phenomena"></a>
III. <i>Geological Phenomena referable to Volcanic Action.</i></p>

<p>Volcanic agency has probably never been less than it is now, and
we ought therefore to find its effects very general and important.</p>

<p>1. The most obvious of these effects are the <i>fractures</i> with
which the crust of the earth is everywhere intersected. The
uplifting force upon which all volcanic phenomena depend would
necessarily fracture the crust, and the wave-like motion resulting
from the fracture would cause numerous secondary fractures, having
a parallel direction. They are often of such extent, during
earthquakes, as to endanger life. During the great earthquake at
Lisbon, in 1755, a fracture opened of sufficient width to swallow
up the quay, and several thousands of persons who had fled there
for safety. The chasm remained permanently open to the depth
of six hundred feet. The earthquakes with which the valley of
the Mississippi was visited in 1811 so often fissured the surface,
that the inhabitants protected themselves by clinging to the trunks
of trees, which they felled transversely to the direction of the
fissures.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 172px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_80" id="Fig_80"></a>Fig. 80.</p>
<img src="images/fig080.png" width="172" height="69" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first fracture which is produced by the upheaving force will
open upwards, and scarcely reach down to the seat of the force.
But there will be other parallel fractures, dependent upon the first,
and opening downward. Thus, the primary fracture at <i>a</i> (<a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>)
will be at once followed by the fracture
<i>b</i>, opening toward the lava, which will
be injected into it, and which, on cooling,
will form a <i>dike</i>. Their formation
is mostly concealed from observation,
but not always. During the eruption of √Ütna, in 1669,
numerous fissures opened, one of which was six feet wide and
twelve miles in length; and the light emitted from it indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that it was filled with lava to near the surface. The process was
as perfectly seen as from the nature of the case it could be.</p>

<p>2. The conversion of the lower sedimentary strata into <i>metamorphic
rocks</i> has been effected by volcanic heat. The material
of which dikes consist has been injected in a highly-heated state;
and, by observing the effect which they have had upon the adjacent
rocks, we may judge of the effect which subterranean heat must
have upon the lower mechanical strata. Wherever the dikes are
of considerable thickness, they have converted the adjacent shales
into primary slate, the sandstones into quartz rock, and the dark
and friable limestones into granular marble, and destroyed the
organic impressions. In the southern extremity of Norway there
is a district in which granite protrudes in a large mass through
fossiliferous strata. These strata are invariably <i>altered</i> to a distance
of from fifty to four hundred yards from the granite. The
shales have become flinty, and resemble jasper; and near the
granite they contain hornblende. The siliceous matter of the
shales has become quartz rock, which sometimes contains hornblende
and mica, and therefore constitutes a kind of granite. The
limestone, which at points remote from the injected rock is an
earthy, blue, coralline limestone, has become a white, granular
marble, near the granite, and the corals are obliterated. The
altered shales and limestones in many places contain garnets, ores
of iron, lead, &amp;c. The annexed (<a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>) is a plan of this granite
and altered rock.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 363px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most instructive examples of metamorphic action in
this country is found in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
These mountains have, till recently, been thought to consist principally
of granite; but it is now ascertained that this supposed
granite is an altered rock of the silurian period. It is represented
as &ldquo;intersected by veins of felspathic granite; and the general
mass is itself in many parts converted into a near approximation
to a binary granite, composed of distinctly developed quartz and
white felspar, with a few sparsely scattered specks of mica. In
its weathered surfaces it wears a close resemblance to some fine-grained
granites; but, upon inspecting a fresh fracture with a
magnifier, we instantly perceive many rounded grains of quartzose
sand, and the felspar is imperfectly formed, though the mica has
more nearly reached the condition which it has in granite. In
some of the coarse varieties of this white rock, small rounded pebbles
of quartz are to be seen, giving unequivocal evidence, even to
the naked eye, of its being an altered sandstone. We feel no hesitation
in deciding it to have been a silico-argillaceous white sandstone,
now almost granitized by extensive metamorphic action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similar illustrations, on a small scale, may be seen in every
country where the strata have been cut through by intrusive dikes.
Sir James Hall has shown the same by actual experiment. He
exposed pulverized chalk to heat sufficient to melt it, and under
sufficient pressure to prevent the escape of the carbonic acid.
After cooling, the chalk was found to have taken the form of crystallized
limestone. But instances enough have been given to show
what changes should be looked for wherever the sedimentary rocks
have been exposed to a high temperature.</p>

<p>The lower strata must have been exposed, for long periods of
time, to such a temperature. We do not know at what depth
below the surface of the earth the rocks become liquid; but above
the line of actual fusion there must be a mass of rock not melted,
yet scarcely retaining the solid form. For a great thickness, perhaps
for several miles, it would be in a more or less yielding state.
As there is not actual fusion, the stratification is not destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
but such a degree of mobility among the particles exists, that some
degree of crystallization takes place, and the elastic forces below
easily bend, throw into folds, compress, and in every way contort
these strata. At the same time, any organic matters which they
may contain are decomposed, and the impressions of them are
obliterated. And such is the condition in which the metamorphic
strata are actually found.</p>

<p>3. <i>Denudation</i> is, in a great measure, dependent on volcanic
action. It results from the billowy motion peculiar to the earthquake.
This is not simply a violent horizontal motion, but an
equally violent vertical one. It is a series of waves,&mdash;a succession
of alternate elevations and depressions of the solid crust.
The height of these waves can only be judged of by their effects;
but it is difficult to account for some of these effects, without supposing
the waves to have been several yards in height, and their
velocity, in the few instances in which the time has been accurately
determined, was twenty miles a minute.</p>

<p>That such earthquake waves actually exist there can be no doubt.
During the earthquake in Calabria, in 1783, the flagstones in
many of the towns were lifted from their places and thrown down
inverted, and trees bent so that their tops touched the ground.
During the great earthquake in Chili, in 1835, the walls of houses,
which were parallel to the line of oscillation, were thrown down,
while those that were at right angles to it, though greatly fractured,
were often left standing. Wherever careful observations
have been made, during and after severe earthquakes, analogous
facts have been noticed. Persons are generally affected with
sea-sickness. The sea is violently agitated. It often retires to
an unusual distance, and then returns upon the shore with most
destructive waves. Incredible, therefore, as it may seem, that the
solid crust of the earth should be thrown into such wave-like undulations,
the fact is well established.</p>

<p>With a velocity of twenty miles an hour, the successive waves
may be some miles apart, and yet be sufficient to account for all
the phenomena. It is evident, therefore, that the curvature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
wave will be very slight, and yet enough to break into fragments
all the rocks thus curved. During the earthquake in Chili,
before referred to, &ldquo;the ground was fissured, in many parts, in
north and south lines. Some of the fissures near the cliffs were a
yard wide. Many enormous masses had fallen on the beach. The
effect of the vibrations on the hard primary slates was still more
curious. The superficial parts of some narrow ridges were as
completely shivered as if they had been blasted by gunpowder.&rdquo;
Similar phenomena seem everywhere to be exhibited by earthquakes.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that almost all parts of the earth have, at
different periods, been subject to these earthquake waves. Accordingly,
we find that the crust of the earth is nowhere in an entire
state, but is divided by irregular lines into comparatively small
fragments. By this means, the deep fissures produced by fractures
opening upwards would be filled with fragments of rock shattered
from the uplifted edges. In this way the boulder masses were
originally loosened from their parent beds, and exposed to the
action of ice, or any other transporting agencies. In the same
way the rocky bed of the ocean is, to a considerable depth, reduced
to a disintegrated mass. In this condition it will be rapidly
removed by marine currents, more or less broken, worn and comminuted,
by the movement, and deposited elsewhere. The materials
have thus been furnished for a very large proportion of the
sedimentary rocks, and especially of those which are composed of
distinct fragments of other rocks. By this means, also, wherever
the rock formations come to the surface, they are so broken that
limestone, sandstone or granite, suitable for architectural purposes,
is seldom found, except at considerable depths. This fragmentary
condition of the surface rock is such as exposes it to be acted upon
readily by any powerfully abrading causes, or to be more rapidly
disintegrated by atmospheric and aqueous causes.</p>

<p>4. We have already assumed that one principal division of rocks&mdash;the
unstratified&mdash;is of igneous origin. We have the proof
of actual observation, that lavas, and the accompanying <i>tufas</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
<i>grits</i>, are volcanic products. The peculiarities of these products,
in situation, structure, and form, and in the imbedded minerals,
are so great, that whenever we find these peculiarities in the rocks
of a country not now volcanic, we still regard these rocks as of
volcanic origin. We thus have lavas, as well as stratified rocks,
of different ages. There has probably been no time in the earth&rsquo;s
history when they have not been forming.</p>

<p>The <i>trappean rocks</i> are also of igneous origin. It is evident,
from their occurring in the form of dikes, that they have been in
a melted state. As they rest upon rocks of a sedimentary origin,
they must have been thrown up by volcanic forces. Yet they differ
from ordinary lavas. They are not vesicular in their structure,
are more crystalline, and there is in no case evidence that
they have flowed from craters. If we regard them as the lavas of
submarine volcanoes, we shall have conditions which will account
for all their peculiarities. At a certain depth the pressure of the
water would be sufficient to prevent the formation and escape of
vapor, and therefore the lavas thus ejected would not be vesicular.
As the rapid cooling of lavas depends, in a great degree, upon the
escape of watery vapor, submarine lavas would cool slowly, in consequence
of the pressure. The liquidity depending in part upon
the retention of the heat, and in part upon the retention of the
aqueous vapor, they would consequently remain in a liquid state
much longer than the lavas of sub-a√´rial volcanoes. They would
therefore take a more highly crystalline form. All the loose
materials thrown out during the eruption would be removed by
oceanic currents, and hence no cone would be built up around the
orifice of eruption. We may therefore regard the trappean rocks
as the lavas of submarine volcanoes. The present volcanoes of
this kind are necessarily producing the same kind of rocks, though
there will be no other proof that they exist, except the existence
of the volcano, till the bed of the sea becomes dry land.</p>

<p>The <i>granitic rocks</i> are also the product of igneous causes.
Granite is the most abundant of these crystalline rocks; and the
others, such as crystalline limestone, are so intimately associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with granite that they must have had the same origin. Granite
is everywhere found to send off dikes into the overlying rocks,
and must therefore have been in a state of fusion; that is, it must
have existed as lava beneath the surface. It is obvious that fluid
lava always exists in great quantity beneath areas of energetic
volcanic activity.</p>

<p>Portions of this lava must in succession take the solid form.
Wherever the surface is elevated along a line of fracture, the lava
which is accumulated beneath rises above the level of the general
reservoir of lava, and will therefore part with its heat more rapidly.
On cooling, it becomes the granitic nucleus of the mountain. We
ought also to suppose that, by the extremely slow process of the
transmission of heat to the surface, the crust of the earth is everywhere
increasing in thickness; that is, the upper portion of the
great lava mass is solidifying.</p>

<p>Sir James Hall has shown, by experiment, that earthy substances,
reduced to a state of fusion, become more highly crystalline
as they are allowed to cool more slowly, and are subjected to
greater pressure. It is difficult to conceive of these conditions
existing in a higher degree than they do in the cooling masses of
lava below the stratified rocks. These lavas must therefore take the
highly crystalline form which the granitic rocks are found to have.</p>

<p>All the igneous rocks have therefore existed as subterranean
lavas. The volcanic rocks have become vitreous, the granitic are
crystalline, and the trappean are intermediate in structure, coinciding
with the circumstances of pressure and rate of cooling
under which they have severally been formed.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Elevation of Mountains</i> is another result of volcanic
action. The height of mountains depends, in part, upon general
elevation. Yet there is a different action, upon which the existence
of the mountain, as such, depends. Whenever igneous action
becomes intense under any portion of the earth&rsquo;s surface, and the
elastic force greater than the repressive, the solid crust will be
broken and raised up, and along this line of fracture the lava will
rise above its general level elsewhere. This lava, thus lifted out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the general mass, in time solidifies, and forms the nucleus of a
mountain. At successive periods the elevating force is renewed,
and adds somewhat to the mountain mass before supplied. In this
way the mountain is ultimately formed.</p>

<p>So far as observations have been made, the elevation of mountains
seems not to be gradual, but spasmodic; and yet the elevating
force probably accumulates constantly and uniformly. The repressing
force consists of the weight of the strata above, which may be
regarded as constant, and their strength, which is variable. When
the elevating force becomes greater than both the repressing forces,
the crust is fractured. The strength of the strata then becomes
nothing, and the repressing force is the weight alone. The elastic
mass below at once expands, and the requisite space is furnished by
the uplifting of the strata along the line of fracture. As the ridge
of lava which fills this additional space cools, it recloses, in part,
the original fracture, and the repressing force again consists of the
two elements,&mdash;weight and strength. There will therefore be no
further elevation till the elevating force is again superior to these
two forces. Thus the elevating force, though it may accumulate
at a uniform rate, will manifest itself only at considerable intervals.</p>

<p>As the accumulation of lava along the line of fracture is the
cause of the upheaval, every mountain must have a central granitic
axis. Sometimes this granitic mass is pushed up through the
fissure, as in the case of Mont Blanc. At other times, the stratified
rock, which formed the original surface, is carried up so as to form
the surface rock nearly to the top. In either case, the strata are
lifted along the line of fracture, and left in an <i>inclined position</i>.
In this position the older rocks are always found, wherever there
has been any considerable amount of igneous disturbance.</p>

<p>In some instances, the additional space required by the expansion
of the igneous mass below is furnished, not by the uplifting
of the strata, but by their compression into folds between two lines
of upheaval. The igneous rock is elevated but little above the
stratified through which it had burst; but the stratified rocks have
taken the undulatory form, and the widening of the igneous mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
along the lines of fracture has compressed the undulations, until
the planes of <i>the strata have become vertical</i>. <a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a> will give
an idea of the successive changes by which the vertical position of
the strata has been produced.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 352px;">
<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_82" id="Fig_82"></a>Fig. 82.</p>

</div>

<p>The force by which mountains are elevated being the elasticity of
the vapor diffused through the subjacent lava, it may happen, if the
lava have a high degree of fluidity, that this vapor will collect in large
masses, and rise as far as the lava is in a fluid state. The irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
flow of lava from craters during an eruption is undoubtedly due
to the rapid ascent of such steam bubbles through the lava. Such
an accumulation of vapor under a mountain mass, if it cannot
escape, would support it as long as the temperature remained
unchanged. But, upon a reduction of temperature, the mass which
had been upheaved by it would be unsupported, and liable at any
time to sink. Instances of <i>subsidence</i> on a comparatively small
scale will admit of explanation in this way. Papandayang, one
of the loftiest volcanic mountains of Java, sunk down four thousand
feet in the year 1772. The area engulfed was sixteen miles long
and six broad. The crater of Kilauea, in one of the Sandwich
Islands, was evidently formed in this way. It is situated on the
side of a mountain, and consists of a chasm eight miles in circumference
and a thousand feet in depth. Liquid lava can always
be seen boiling in the small craters at the bottom; and at times it
rises so as to overflow them, and fill the chasm to within four hundred
feet of the top, when lateral subterranean passages are opened, by
which it is discharged. The same explanation&mdash;a depression of
the central portion&mdash;may be given of the formation of the large
craters in the Canary and Grecian islands. It is also probable that
Lake Avernus and others, in Italy, and some in Germany, have
had a similar origin.</p>

<p>The subsidence of Papandayang is of importance as a historical
fact; and it is not at all unreasonable to suppose that larger chasms
of great depth were also sudden subsidences of a similar character.
Lake Superior has a depth considerably greater than the elevation
of its surface above the level of the sea. The bottom of the Dead
Sea is two thousand six hundred feet below the surface of the
Mediterranean. And at one place in the Atlantic Ocean a sounding
was attempted with more than six miles of line, without reaching
bottom. These sunken areas, however, though of great extent,
occupy only an insignificant portion of the entire surface of the
earth.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Elevation of Continents.</i>&mdash;The causes of change of
level which have been given will not explain those <i>slow vertical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
movements</i> which are now taking place in Greenland and the north
of Europe, or those by which the present continents have been
elevated and the bed of the sea depressed. Any cause which will
account for these movements must be one operating for long
periods, under large areas, and with great uniformity.</p>

<p>The cause which fulfils all these conditions most satisfactorily is
a <i>variation of temperature</i> in the mass of rock underlying the
portion of the surface whose level is changing. It has before been
shown that the temperature increases as we descend below the surface;
but there is also reason to suppose that it undergoes great
variations. The volcanic grits interstratified with the silurian
rocks of England show that at the silurian period volcanic fires
were active below that portion of the surface. When the early
fossiliferous rocks of this country were deposited, the Alleghany
Mountains had not been elevated; but before the tertiary period
they had taken nearly their present form. Some portion of the
intermediate period was therefore one of volcanic upheaval. The
trappean rocks are also evidence of intense volcanic action existing
here. France, during the tertiary period, was a highly volcanic
country; but all volcanic activity has now subsided. The Andes
have been mostly elevated since the tertiary period, and are still
rising. It is evident, then, that at different periods volcanic heat
may vary from its highest to its least degree of activity, below
any portion of the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>

<p>This variation of temperature must be followed by variation of
volume of the earth&rsquo;s crust; that is, it <i>must produce expansion or
contraction</i>. Experiments have been made, under the direction of
the United States government, to determine the expansion of the
several kinds of rock used in our public works. It was found that
granite expands nearly one two hundred thousandth of its length
for every degree of increased temperature, limestone somewhat
more than that, and sandstone about twice as much. Taking the
expansion of the granite as the basis of calculation, and supposing
the crust for a hundred miles in thickness to be undergoing change
of temperature, there would be a resulting difference of level
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
exceeding two and a half feet for each degree of change in temperature,
or more than two thousand five hundred feet for a change of
one thousand degrees.</p>

<p>This calculation is made upon the supposition that the law of
expansion is the same for all temperatures, and that no new conditions
are introduced at high temperatures by the presence of
aqueous particles. We know, however, that solids expand more
rapidly at high temperatures than at low, and the elasticity of
aqueous vapor at high temperatures must increase the rate of
expansion of the rock through which it is diffused. Although we
are not able to introduce, numerically, the effect of these two circumstances,
yet it is obvious that they must be considerable.</p>

<p>The mean elevation of land above the level of the sea is about
nine hundred feet, the mountain masses above that level not being
included; and the estimated mean depth of the ocean, not including
its chasms, does not exceed two thousand six hundred feet.
The <i>total elevation of the continental masses</i>, for which it is necessary
to account, does not therefore exceed three thousand five hundred
feet. This amount of vertical movement may evidently be
produced by the expansion and contraction resulting from changes
of temperature.</p>

<p>These changes of level must, however, be very gradual. Any
diminution of temperature must result from the transfer of heat to
the surface; and the conducting power of rocks is very imperfect.
The lava in a crater is often so cooled on the surface that it can be
walked on, while but a few feet below it is still liquid. Lava currents
continue in gradual motion long after the surface is nearly
cold. This was the case with one of the currents from √Ütna for
more than nine months after its eruption, and with another for
ten years. Humboldt visited Jorullo forty years after it was
thrown up, when the lava around the mountain was still in a
heated state, the temperature in the fissures being on the decrease
from year to year; but twenty years after its ejection the heat
was still sufficient to light a cigar at the depth of a few inches.
If so long a period is insufficient to solidify a comparatively small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
quantity of melted rock when the circumstances for cooling are
most favorable, we may well suppose that centuries would be
required to abstract sufficient heat from the earth&rsquo;s crust to produce
any material change in the areas of continents.</p>

<p>If this account of the elevation and subsidence of continents is
correct, it would seem that they ought to be constantly undergoing
change of level. And their <i>apparent stability</i> may be regarded
as an objection to it. If in any place there is absolutely no vertical
movement, then those conditions must exist in which, for the
time being, there is no change of temperature.</p>

<p>But it is doubtful whether there ever is absolute stability of
any portion of the surface for long periods of time. Of the minor
vertical movements of the interior of continents, there can, from
the nature of the case, be no evidence whatever. Changes of
level, where they are known to be taking place, are so slow, that
they are hardly perceptible in the period of a human life. Such
changes had been going on for centuries in Sweden before they were
suspected. As accurate observations have increased in number,
and historical records become available, it is becoming known that
a very large amount of the seaboard is undergoing change of level.
It becomes probable, then, that these extremely slow changes of
level are constantly and everywhere taking place.</p>

<p>That portion of the crust of the earth constituting the present
continents, being further removed from the centre, would part with
its heat more rapidly, and receive heat from the central mass more
slowly, than that portion which at present constitutes the bed of
the sea. The continents are therefore in a situation to undergo
contraction and depression, and the bed of the sea is most favorably
situated for rising. If the distribution of water through the mass
has any influence in promoting its expansion, then the bed of the
sea would receive this supply most abundantly, and the continents
the least so. We see, then, in nature, those provisions for an
alteration of level, which, from the character of the several rock
formations, we know to have taken place. When any portion of
the earth&rsquo;s surface is covered with the sea, the conditions exist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which will at length elevate it. When it becomes dry land, the
conditions exist which will in time depress it below the level of the
ocean. Hence, those impressions in regard to the land, as stable
beyond the possibility of change, we ought to abandon; and those
vertical movements, which, when proved, we are accustomed to
regard as extraordinary, we shall, at length, consider as only particular
instances of one of the most general laws of nature.</p>

<p>7. <i>Variations of Climate.</i>&mdash;The only sources of heat by which
climate can be affected are the sun and the heated interior of the
earth.</p>

<p>If the former melted condition of the entire mass of the earth
be assumed, the temperature of the surface must have been increased,
by conduction of heat from within, for long periods after
the superficial stratum had become solid. It is, however, susceptible
of proof, that the present climates are not sensibly affected by
interior heat, though at a little more than a mile below the surface
the temperature is equal to that of boiling water. At any time,
therefore, after the waters had become condensed, collected into
oceans, and become sufficiently cool to support the animal life of
which the remains are now found, it is not probable that the climate
was, to any considerable extent, influenced by the heat conducted
from the interior.</p>

<p>Still, there have been great changes of climate since those early
organic forms existed; and, since we have no ground for supposing
that the temperature of the sun&rsquo;s rays has suffered any reduction,
we have to inquire whether the means of retaining the heat from
the sun could at any time have been different. <i>The relative position
of land and water</i> depends, as we have seen, upon igneous
causes, and has been very different at different times. We shall
find that climate must have been greatly modified by these changes;
for the land radiates and absorbs heat freely, and water possesses
this power in a very low degree.</p>

<p>Let us suppose the zone comprised between the tropics to be
occupied by land, and the portions without these limits to be
covered with water. Under these conditions, the land, having a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
nearly vertical sun the whole time, would accumulate heat to a
degree scarcely compatible with the existence of animal life. This
is sufficiently proved by the oppressive tropical climates of the
present time, influenced as they are by polar lands and contiguous
seas.</p>

<p>Under the same conditions, the sea would be heated by contact
with the land, and the heat would be distributed by marine currents
to the polar regions. But the water thus distributed would
not part with its heat, because it has but little radiating power,
and nowhere comes in contact with polar land. It follows, then,
that both land and water would be subjected to a very high
temperature.</p>

<p>But, if we suppose the land confined to the polar regions, and
the sea to the equatorial, the opposite results would follow. The
equatorial sea would absorb but a small proportion of the solar heat
which would be thrown upon it. The land would receive the sun&rsquo;s
rays too obliquely to receive much elevation of temperature, as the
present polar climates show. Hence, the temperature of the earth
would differ but little from that of the planetary spaces, which is
fifty-eight degrees below zero, a temperature too low to allow of
any considerable development of organic life.</p>

<p>These are the conclusions to which we are led by considering
the different powers of land and water to absorb and radiate heat,
and we shall find that the existing climates are in accordance with
these conclusions. America has a lower temperature than Europe
in the same latitudes. It has also a smaller proportion of land in
the equatorial regions, and a greater proportion in the north polar
regions. The eastern continent is colder in Asia than in Europe
in the same latitudes. It has also less equatorial and more polar
land. The southern is colder than the northern hemisphere at
equal distances from the equator. There is also less land near the
equator on the south side, and probably as much land around the
south as the north pole.</p>

<p>Hence, we see that there may have been such a relation of land
and water as to account for all the variations of temperature which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
are known to have existed. We cannot say that such actually has
been the case. We can tell, with some degree of accuracy, what
portions of the present continents were land at the several geological
periods; but three-fourths of the surface of the earth is covered
with water, and of the condition of this portion during those
periods we have no means even of conjecturing. We can only
say, that, by the operation of known causes, the relative position of
land and water may have been such as to produce the climates
known to have existed at former periods of the history of the
earth.</p>
